Consumer loan financing. Our first payment was due XX/XX/2021. I called to pay that but was advised our loan was sold to Selene finance XX/XX/2021. Therefore my payment was denied. As I was told all payment history on file was null and void with consumer loan financing as of the XXXX of XXXX. I spoke to consumer to see whom we were sold to. The response was Selene finance. Consumer gave me their number and I immediately started calling. I can not tell you how many times I called Selene probably 30x at least! I started calling around the XXXX of XXXX prettt much begging them to take a payment which had been agreed upon for the loan modification. Selene told me they could not take anything as records had not been downloaded from consumer and they couldnt prove they were my mortgager or that I had a modification. I was told to call back in a couple weeks. This continued I for many months. Then all of a sudden around XXXX they said they had the information and if I wanted to keep my house I had to pay 3 months all at once! At this point I knew we had put in for Covid relief funds thru Vermont and we would be approved. I told them this and every person I spoke to had something different to say! I would ask to speak to a manger and was told no multiple times! They would pass me through and if they did we never received a call back! Finally I knew we weee approved by Vermonts VHFA! But they could t pay bc Selene wasnt boarded with them! They too tried to contact Selene and got no where! Selene then sent our mortgage to a law ex firm for foreclosure. This was news to us we never received a letter from the sheriff saying so or even in the mail! Honestly our loan being sent to a law office probably add things easier for us as they actually responded to our calls and emails! MY DISPUTE IS THAT SELENE charged us for XXXX dollars in attorney fees when it never shouldve gotten this far had they honored the modification in early XXXX. Which I was told by my previous mortgager that was a law and they had to for 90 days! I would like to be reindorsed this money as this was on Selene and not us.

Then in XX/XX/XXXX our bankruptcy attorney gets information that we are over {$5500.00} in arrears and that we had n't paid our mortgage since XX/XX/XXXX. We sent all the proof that we were paying our bills and every person and attorney that our attorney spoke with had a different explanation and amount that was due. Needless to say, we determined that it was the difference between the {$1400.00} and the {$1400.00} that had actually caused the shortages and brought our account 100 % current in XX/XX/XXXX. Now on XX/XX/XXXX we get 3 letters dated within 1 day of each other advising us that we are in arrears {$5200.00} which is money owed since XX/XX/XXXX.

They send my monthly statements but the amounts that they claim that I owe are not consistent even though I make my monthly mortgage payment for the amount that it is supposed to be. I am also paid one month ahead on my mortgage payment and because of how they apply the funds they say that I am not a month ahead, even though I am. Also i received a statement from them stating that my mortgage payment went up {$230.00} monthly and then another stating that is went up {$270.00} monthly. They say it is because I have a escrow shortage, however my taxes have not gone up almost {$3000.00}. Also they said I had a escrow shortage of {$1600.00}. I did pay the amount of {$1600.00} for their alleged escrow shortage so my monthly payment would remain the same, also I paid it because I figured that if it proves to not be truthful information then they would legally owe me that amount back, I do not feel comfortable giving them any extra funds due to the fact that nothing is ever applied correctly, but I did pay that as additional directly to my escrow account. I had called them and spoke with a woman by the name of XXXX on XXXX XXXX when I received the first statement saying I would owe a higher amount than usual and was for my XXXX payment. I had already made my XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX, She even got on a XXXX way conference call with my bank that I make the monthly payment from so I could prove that all of my payments were made and that I am paid XXXX month ahead. In XX/XX/XXXX they took my monthly mortgage payment and applied {$420.00} as additional principal which I never asked to have done and who knows what they did with the remainder of my payment, XXXX said that must have caused the issue so she would have a payment audit of my account done, which to date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) has not been performed. Then I have a statement stating that I owe my mortgage payment + a increase to that amount of {$270.00} monthly. and it says it is due XX/XX/XXXX, I have already made not only my XXXX payment but I also have made my XX/XX/XXXX which was withdrawn from my account on XX/XX/XXXX as well as another payment of {$1600.00} to the escrow account additionally. I called to request another escrow analysis be performed to reflect that I paid the shortage, I spoke with a woman named XXXX and then a woman named XXXX. XXXX said she will request the escrow analysis be redone, but claims even though I paid the shortage that the escrow will still be short and that my monthly payment will be at least {$110.00} additionall to my monthly payment that my escrow is actually short. {$2800.00} not {$1600.00} even though that is the amount they said it was short. Then I asked to be transferred back to XXXX because she was helping me to resolve the situation of having my monthly payment get rectified, however I was told that she is available but not responding so they took my contact info. She was supposed to call me back, she has not yet done so. She said that she had to talk to a different department at the time and they were not open yet, which is their bankruptcy dept. We did have to file bankruptcy due to ongoing problems with this mortgage provider, The bankruptcy has been discharged, however XXXX said that the XXXX payment where they only took {$420.00} and applied it to additional principal, when I actually paid my usual payment of {$1400.00}. That it occured when we were in bankruptcy even though the bankruptcy was discharged on XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore that department had to correct it. but we have not been able to get ahold of that department nor has their own representatives.

I again made calls to talk with representatives and was told to go ahead and pay the taxes on my own. On XX/XX/XXXX I paid off the taxes and the late fees before any additional fees would be added. To pay the taxes and late fees I used money that sits in an interest accruing account that is designated as my family 's emergency fund. On XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX I called Cardinal and this time asked to speak to a manager. She explained to me that the taxes and late fees would have been taken care of if I hadn't asked for my escrow account to be closed. She did slip up and say that the order had been placed and was pending to have the taxes/late fees paid ( which was never made clear to me ) but since the escrow account was requested to be closed they are no longer liable to pay the fees. If the order was in for this to be taken care of and the fees covered why can I not be reimbursed for the late fees that I paid? From the beginning I was given different answers on how to resolve this issue. Having unpaid taxes was not only embarrassing but a nuisance for my family and I. I have seen numerous complaints on the XXXX XXXX XXXX website that this has become a common occurrence. I would like to be reimbursed for the fees that were added to my property taxes.

I had 12 months to refinance removing my ex spouse. Of course 4 weeks after divorce quarantine happened and I was financially negatively affected due to covid 19. I chose the option of forbearance under the cares act. Hopeful it was temporary. In XX/XX/XXXX I started the process I thought to end forbearance only to find out that my ex spouse had filed chapter XXXX  bankruptcy. I was not involved in that in any way. During that process for her I could not do anything with my mortgage including making payments. The end of XX/XX/XXXX there was a judgment and she was no longer in active bankruptcy, she did include this mortgage in her bankruptcy and it was reaffirmed so not to affect my being there as long as I continue to make my payments. XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo drafted a modification to end forbearance. I immediately upon receiving it signed it notarized and returned the modification. My ex-spouse decided to ignore it all together. After months had gone by with no one able to reach my XXXX the modification agreement expired and then I was back to square one. I began the process over again this time without a modification because my intention was to refinance as soon as possible once making the three on TimXXXX payments necessary. That was over 4 months ago that that process was initiated. This time I submitted in the documentation the divorce decree showing my entitlement to the property, a quit claim deed signed and notarized by my ex spouse and handled by my attorney. Of course she also has the chapter XXXX judgment which included Wells Fargo from the year prior. I was told underwriting accepted all the documentation and it was a matter of waiting for the paperwork to be generated. This would allow the forbearance to be lifted without her signature given the documentation provided. After calling Wells Fargo now multiple times learning yesterday on XX/XX/XXXX that the paperwork that was generated was sent to my ex-spouses bankruptcy attorney. Here 's the problem I don't know who that attorney is, he should not have my information my personal information because I did not hire him secondly she is no longer in active bankruptcy therefore there is no need to involve her attorney in any way. Next there was no need to involve her for anybody that may be related to her situation because the quit claim deed along with her chapter XXXX bankruptcy and the divorce decree was enough by law uninvolve her in the process as she only was trying to be a hindrance through ignorance. All that said I initiated the initial process of removing the forbearance nearly 17 months ago. I've been making my regular payments. And desperately want to get this process done so that emotionally I can move on but also interest rates have been at an all-time low and I would like to take advantage of that savings opportunity. I am one income. Any savings is a big safe. I will be saving over {$700.00} a month by refinancing. I can't do that until the forbearance is lifted. Her bankruptcy is not the fault of Wells Fargo and they handled their business there accordingly however this last 4 months and counting is certainly their mistake in the delay. And providing my information to an attorney that is no longer employed by my ex spouse and was never employed by myself. Any information of mine that he receives without my authorization or under any legal pretense is a violation of the privacy act and my rights. This has been a terrible experience start to finish. I want closure and I want to move on. I want to save the money I should already be saving. If the interest rate were to go up a half percent before I refinance from where it has been, that is a cost of over {$30000.00} over the life of the loan to me. This lost opportunity would be squarely on the fault of the lender. I did not find it this process to be that challenging or difficult given I provided all the necessary paperwork documentation and was agreeable through the whole process. At this point however I'm not happy. I've been nice and I've been cordial and I've been understanding and pleasant. That goes away now. It's unacceptable. I would like remediation and this situation brought to a close immediately. Thank you and please if there's anything I'm missing do contact.

We were hoping to close last week but because they have given me the runaround, all my other creditor payoff quotes have become or soon will expire. I have been assessed late fees from my credit card companies, and surely will be reported as having late payments to the major credit reporting bureaus. Not only this- the reason TMS is refusing to update the payoff letter is because they are claiming I owe them roughly $ XXXX for a partial claim that HUD has ( and has paid off ) on my home. In XXXX I applied for a forbearance on my mortgage loan because I lost my job due to the COVID pandemic. In XXXX, I started working again and began making payments. The amount that I did not pay during the forbearance period went into a partial claim with HUD or XXXX. I signed the documents and have notarized copies ( attached ) of the promissory note and deed with states this. However, TMS will states that I owe them for the partial claim. The title company that I'm working with received a payoff letter from HUD/XXXX which states I owe them for the partial claim. I just want to refinance and finally be done with TMS - they are the worst company in the history of companies. They never call me back when I ask.

This issue has arisen due the fact of an approved forbearance agreement with suspended mo. payments of {$0.00} from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. This was due to the impact of Co-Vid19 hardship. In my paperwork it states that in accordance with the Federal CARES Act the status of the account at the start of the forbearance would be preserved throughout the forbearance period. That if your account was delinquent at the time the forbearance began it would continue in delinquency status that existed at the start of the of the forbearance throughout the forbearance period. If, however, the account is brought to current it would be reported as current throughout the forbearance period. In a letter date XX/XX/XXXX Dovenmuehle required a default payment of {$1800.00} on or before XX/XX/XXXX. I then worked in conjunction with XXXX CARES mortgage relief program through XXXX XXXX XXXX  to have the default cured in the proper time. I was under forbearance from XXXX through XXXX XXXX. I began making payments again and no longer had a need to be under forbearance. However, although I'd begun to make payments through loss mitigation as I'd no longer received a payment booklet and only had past due statements, they continued to have me under forbearance status through XXXX XXXX. I then received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating a recent review of my account showed funds were received for payment due XX/XX/XXXX and that the amount of {$59.00} was posted to the account as unapplied funds and was not applied as a mortgage payment.

I was the able to find them by searching the web and made contact. The new mortgager ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) they told me ..yes my loan was being transferred to them however they would not officially take it over until the XXXX, and that I should make mr payment to Caliber. I called Caliber back and again was told ... no ..I had to pay it to the new loan mortgager as we don't manage you loan anymore.

I got the same answer. In addition they informed me that because I missed the payment date that I would be no longer eligible for the modification because I didn't meet the modification requirements even though they refuse to take the payment. So I had to wait in for XXXX  to completely have all of my information and officially take over my loan after the XXXX to speak with them.

I faxed them the acceptance paperwork from caliber showing that I did qualify and what my trial payments were. A few weeks went by I hadn't heard anything from XXXX  so I contacted them again. Then for me at the time that they didn't receive my paperwork even though I had an fax confirmation. I then re faxed it again to XXXX. Few weeks more went by I heard nothing. I called back to XXXX and basically they told me that caliber sent them a letter saying that they had put me a caliber put me into foreclosure which I was never told that and I shouldn't have been as I was going through the process of them with for the modification. XXXX said they didn't receive very much information from caliber and that they were trying to get more information about it. That they would let me know. Of course nobody ever let me know anything. Then few weeks more went by I called back and they at that time asked me to email or fax their packet for modification or assistance. Sorry did that and also send them again another copy of the approval had gotten from caliber for modification. About 5 weeks went by and we just received a letter now stating that congratulations you are approved to short sale your home and deed in lieu. Congratulations!!! How is that congratulating me that I'm going to lose my house is viewed as a good thing!! I thought they were trying to help me! But now I feel like all they're trying to do is take my property!! Of course I called them really upset. Ask to speak to a manager. Spoke with her at length basically the girl on the phone to answer the phone originally told me I owe it doesn't matter they are going to review it again pretty much that's their decision so there's nothing you can do about it.

       " Row(Date received='2019-10-17', Product='Mortgage', Sub-product='Conventional home mortgage', Issue='Closing on a mortgage', Sub-issue=None, Consumer complaint narrative='- [ ] I went through XXXX to obtain a loan serviced by Bank of America. The home had mold and repairs that needed to be made so we had to go through a rehab procedure. XXXX says online, in literature, at the workshops and in person that there is never a fee for their services, no down payments or closing cost. We began working with them in XX/XX/XXXX and attended three workshops before our process officially began in XX/XX/XXXX and we finally closed XX/XX/XXXX. We had a closing scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX but they could not get things done in time concerning the rehab cost etc. XXXX XXXX ( Rehab Dept ) Director kept changing the amounts after wed already accepted the bid which inflated our loan. XXXX XXXX XXXX, who manages the rehab process, took the inspection report and sent us what needed to be repaired. We were required to get a contractor to give us a bid and once we accepted it then we were to be cleared by XXXX and be able to close. After we agreed with the contractor and signed off, XXXX added things we didnt need like a new roof when the house had a new one and a basement build back that we didnt want or need. The rehab cost went from the {$38000.00} to {$47000.00} to {$57000.00} because the XXXX Director would take off the roof but fluff other numbers and so on. Even after we closed she tried to get us to sign off on a {$66000.00} rehab scope of work which I refused because of the trend of them going up and saying sign this if you want to continue. I found out later that XXXX XXXX XXXX gets a percentage of the final rehab cost so it now makes sense why she kept fluffing the numbers. We only used {$25000.00} though {$57000.00} was figured into our 30 year mortgage. They put around {$28000.00} towards our principle but a couple thousand is still unaccounted for ( {$57000.00} rehab minus {$25000.00} we actually needed to use minus {$28000.00} leaves a few thousand left over ). Then we found out nine months later they charged us the Rehab fee which is supposed to be paid by the lender. The Rehab fee is supposed to be 3 % of the Rehab ( {$57000.00} on one doc ) but they rolled {$1800.00} into our loan which is more than 3 %. Theres also a doc that says the rehab was {$50000.00} and {$1800.00} is still not 3 % of this fee we were never supposed to pay. We were always told the lender pays. When I asked about these discrepancies the Closing Manager, XXXX XXXX asked me, if you knew about the fee would you still have gone through with the loan? I said what does that have to do with anything then he scolded me and accused me of trying to get something from them. When we spoke before this I said I didnt understand the amounts and why we had to bring almost {$19000.00} to close when around {$9000.00} was points we purchased and we were not to pay a closing cost. Without our permission they held {$7700.00} for nine months ( gave me {$1.00} back in interest ). I was told later that due to the confusion at closing they needed to make adjustments and they had to do it that way. All along they say theres no down payment, closing cost and never a fee for their service. The {$7700.00} they held from cash to close overage was placed in the escrow holdbacks to go towards the rehab they said at a later date that we never pre-approved them holding. At one point  they asked for over {$20000.00} in cash to close since we had it in out account. This was decided by Mr. XXXX, the closing manager. There is a contingency of 10 % of the rehab cost which equals about {$5000.00} that got rolled into the loan to cover cost in the event we went over budget. When they surprised us and kept the {$7700.00} cash to close overage and placed it in an escrow holdback account the Rehab Director, XXXX XXXX said it was in case we went over the financed amount which is supposed to be what the 10 % contingency is for so they added an extra {$5000.00} to our loan in case we go over budget. The budget was {$57000.00} and then they felt it was okay to hold {$7700.00} of our money which would give us almost {$65000.00} for rehab and we only needed {$25000.00}. Then we paid out of pocket during the rehab for an HVAC system ( {$7000.00} ) and were not allowed to use our money they had, the {$7700.00} overage they were holding for rehab. I dont understand why our loan had to be inflated again with the contingency fee if they put our overage in escrow for the same purpose. I have been trying for almost a year to have my loan explained. The closing took around six hours after sending us to the bank to get {$22000.00} cash to close but the bank closed early on XX/XX/XXXX to honor the passing of president Bush which the realtor knew about but sent us anyway to buy time. When we returned he and the closing attorney had taken naps per the realtor. Then we were told and given a document saying we needed {$20000.00} cash to close. Mr. XXXX said they were working on the final numbers but in order to close that day we could give the {$20000.00} and Bank of America would cut us a check for any overage. We were asked to sign three different packets with different amounts for our loan and told they were working to straighten out the discrepancies with the lender. One email I received said theyll keep us posted and we were due back {$10000.00} of the cash to close. At one point we decided to leave and the realtor went to get Mr. XXXX and thats when we met him after waiting almost 4 hours we then stayed another 1.5 hours. After XXXX we we told to sign a few more documents and we could wire the money the following day, we just needed the closing date with wet signatures and they had six days to work it out. As we were driving away the closing attorney ran out to our car and had us come in to sign another document. My husband and I worked nights so after working the night before, driving an hour and a half to close, being bounced around for over six hours, driving back, going straight to work, working all night, staying up that next morning anticipating Mr. XXXX call with the final cash to close amount we needed to wire the bank, we finally got to sleep around lunch when Mr. XXXX called to say everything was official. He said he had emails about the overage which was around {$8000.00} ( should have been {$10000.00} ) and he would make sure we got it back. I finally went to sleep thinking we had our home and would be notified concerning the final amounts figured into our loan due to the we have 6 days comments. This never happened. When I was sent an email with the Closing Disclosure and told to sign it in order to close on time, I said the numbers were wrong and was told this was not final but they needed signatures to move forward. I received the email on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX telling me to sign and return by midnight. I saw the email and signed but said it wasnt right. They close at XXXX and there was no one to go over this with me. I called our counselor who never responded to that call. For the next few days the closing coordinator kept sending the same document for me to resubmit because it wasnt legible. She said it was finally received two days prior to close. Then at closing this incorrect document was there for us to sign in our packet. I again said it was wrong and they began trying to fix things. It appears to me they jumbled a few rehab docs together, took out fees and rolled the rest into the loan. When my husband went to the snack machine, our realtor told me how good the loan was even with the discrepancies and I should sign it or the seller will walk. This was the experience the whole time. We were told one thing and railroaded into signing something else. We paid an inspection fee of {$550.00} that was to be credited back since its part of closing and they claim to have no closing cost and told us the lender would credit it to us. They also inflated the PITI which covers mortgage payments during the rehab by {$200.00}. So as it stands for the past two two months a rep from Bank of America has been in contact with XXXX  and had Mr. XXXX call to go line by line and explain what the numbers mean since that didnt happen at closing. When he would get to a point he could not explain, he scolded me and would end the call abruptly. For example, he began to explain the discount points we purchased and said, thats were you purchased seven points. I corrected him and said we only purchased six ( we were not allowed any more ) and he said I have an appointment and got off the phone. I have not heard from him or the Bank of America rep since then and it has been over three weeks. From my calculations we have a couple thousand that was taken from the cash to close that has not been explained and a few thousand unaccounted for that was rolled into the loan. The final loan amount is {$220000.00}. {$57000.00} rehab that was fluffed and rolled into the loan based on BOAs closing documents but about {$50000.00} that Mr. XXXX told me was actually used and in another loan packet. We had around {$19000.00} in cash to close that can not be explained. Ive asked for a breakdown of the escrow holdback and was told by the BOA rep that he would get that to me and had put in a request and thats when communication with him ended. The closing disclosure was changed and signed at closing on XX/XX/XXXX. I have asked since then for clarity. The best explanation I received was from XXXX XXXX Director. She once said it appears they submitted one rehab SOW but used another for the loan causing several thousand dollars difference and she said she would ask that the loan be reassessed. The next time I spoke with her ( after many calls and emails were ignored for along time ) to see if they would redo the loan she said there were no errors and threatened to end the relationship if I speak this way again. Mr. XXXX said he would give back the {$1800.00} plus the interest that I asked for which he said was {$2.00}. Also, the PITI that is rolled into the mortgage to cover the monthly payments while work is being done was not needed because the work took three weeks but they would not clear us to begin although they say work should begin within 30 days after the closing. I was told not to move in until the Director clears me to. They waited until the 5th month to allow the work to begin, didnt pay the contractor until the last month clearing us and we moved in after the PITI was used up. I feel this was strategic as they tried to get me to sign the {$66000.00} SOW that would have included the {$7700.00} overage and made the discrepancies make since.

( the bank ), services our conventional mortgage loan. The loan includes a property tax escrow. The town allows quarterly payments, and the bank had always paid the tax payments quarterly. On XX/XX/XXXX, the bank sent a letter stating it would begin paying the property taxes annually for XXXX, rather than quarterly, to get the 2 % discount that the town offers for paying in full. It noted the change could result in an escrow shortage, which if we did not pay in full, the bank would spread over 24 months in the monthly payment. The letter did not disclose how the escrow account payments would change, or if there would be a shortage. In addition, the letter did not give a choice to waive the 2 % discount, and the possible higher escrow shortage, and stay on the quarterly payment cycle with the town taxes. Around XX/XX/XXXX, the bank sent the annual RESPA Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement. The Account Projection table showed there would be the annual tax payment, and that there was now a {$4000.00} escrow shortage. If we did not pay the shortage in full now, the monthly payment for the next 12 months would cover the shortage increasing our total monthly payment {$330.00}. During a phone call with the Tax Dept, the  representative said that it seemed like an error and they would review the issue and contact me. On XX/XX/XXXX, we received the same RESPA disclosure the bank sent in XX/XX/XXXX. The customer representative in the Tax Dept told me that there was no choice in the matter, although they could spread the escrow shortage over a longer period if the payment was not affordable. After checking with her management, she confirmed that we had no choice and the bank would pay the taxes annually. 1. The bank does not disclose the amount of escrow shortage and payment increases when it decides to go to the annual payment cycle instead of the usual quarterly cycle. 2. The bank does not provide the homeowner an option. 3. The bank disclosed that the shortage would be payable over 24 months when the Annual Escrow Disclosure said it would be 12 months, resulting in the substantively increased payment compared with a 24 month collection ; and 4. Customer Service confirmed today that the servicing system is in fact scheduled to collect the shortage over 12 months, not 24. This is an Unfair Practice because we have no choice in the repayment terms of the taxes on our property and we had no information or ability to change how much the escrow would collect to prevent the shortages. In addition, this is a Deceptive Practice, because the XXXX letter advising of the change did not provide the information we needed, it stated it would collect the shortage over 24 months when it would in fact collect it over 12 months. The bank should provide more information when it gives notice of the change in its practice to pay the taxes annually. In addition and most importantly, the bank should offer homeowners the option to pay the 2 %, or remain on the quarterly cycle and lower the escrow shortage, because to do so would be best suited for their budget.', Company public response=None, Company='CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.', State='RI', ZIP code='02864', Tags=None, Consumer consent provided?='Consent provided', Submitted via='Web', Date sent to company='2019-10-18', Company response to consumer='Closed with monetary relief', Timely response?='Yes', Consumer disputed?='N/A', Complaint ID='3407675'),\n",

The mortgage was pay on time starting XX/XX/XXXX till XX/XX/XXXX when the lender notified me that they did a escrow analysis and my mortgage was projected to be {$6100.00}. My mortgage payments were then adjusted to {$5400.00} for an extended period of time. I paid that amount until XX/XX/XXXX when I has personal issues. The mortgage was eventually modified after several tries and a lawsuit against the lender. Fast forward to today and I have had several structural issues with the house which made me revisit the documents related to the sale of my house. With regards to the lender I filed a complaint with CFPB regarding my loan and as a result they referenced the escrow analysis as if things were normal but then sent me an escrow payment ( which I had never received before for {$900.00} ). This piqued my curiosity so I visited the county treasurer to get the payment history on my taxes and what I found was disturbing to say the least. In XX/XX/XXXX the property taxes paid on my house by the lender {$220.00} which was very low for property taxes. Despite that payment the lender had {$3300.00} escrowed for taxes that it did not pay to the county.

XXXX XXXX years later our balance is {$150000.00} plus I paid two payments towards the Principle. Its just highway robbery but legal. Since, th take over we have never been late but in XXXX I called to let them know I may be a bit late because my employer was dragging their feet with my final check. I am not sure if the Rep. was New or just didnt care but she transferred us and we got disconnected but before she transferred she said someone would be in contact with me. We never heard from anyone so I paid XXXX on time and paid XXXX a few days later. To our dismay they reported us late after I called we were not interested in going intro forbearance just needed a bit more time after getting let go because of this pandemic. The mortgage company basically said they could not help us that the rep never notated the account. I was misguided in thinking that companies would not be reporting late if they were contacted because of their pandemic. Now, that rates are so low we want out of this shady deal but because we are showing late two times on our mortgage we cant do refinance with a lower percentage we want to go down to a 15 year loan to oay it off sooner. I am so distraught about losing my job and now this. I know co- workers who have gone a year without paying and their mortgage company isnt reporting them late because Of COVID. I really believe they dont want to help because they want us bound tI their unreasonable terms and conditions.

I was told by the sales rep that they had an in house lender ( tripointe connect ) which is partly owned by Loan Depot, and would receive a lender incentive toward closing costs of {$7500.00}. I spoke with a loan officer who quoted me a rate of 2.99 % with no points on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage. We called around to other lenders and all including tripointe connect were within .125 % of each other. We elected to use tripointe connect to take advantage of the {$7500.00} incentive. We were told that the longest lock available was 6 months and would include a one time rate float down that could only be done within 45 days of closing. Until then the rate would be floating. In XXXX we locked the loan for 6 months at 3.25 % with a rate adjustment of .25 % to account for the 6 month lock. Therefore our rate was locked at 3.5 % with an anticipated closing date of XX/XX/XXXX. The 6 month lock gave us extra time to account for any delays. Our lock expiration was XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX We contacted the loan officer to see inquire about excersising the one time float down. We were told that rates had risen and were above 3.5 %. Loan Derpot 's rate sheets were available on the internet and showed that we should have been able to float down to 2.99 % with no points. I asked why we weren't being quoted the 2.99 % rate that we were qualified to have. We were told that the branch manager would contact us to discuss our concerns. When the branch manager called he told us that I wasn't understanding what I was reading. I was in the mortgage business for several years and understood perfectly how to read any rate sheet. Our belief is that we were quoted a low rate to entice us to to use tripointe connect. Once we were contractually obligated to use the in house lender there was no longer an obligation to quote a proper rate. They had no idea that there rate sheets were available to the public. We believe this is an ongoing problem with this lender that could effect hundreds if not thousands of borrowers.

In XX/XX/XXXX, loan was sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX. While with XXXX it was very difficult to communicate with them, nothing was done by email, all through USPS. When we could get someone on the phone, they would inform us that paperwork was in the mail.

XX/XX/XXXX finally got some correspondence from XXXX, cancelled deferment and was able to start making payments again.

I also followed up with them numerous times and each time they assured me that it will be taken care of. However, mr cooper paid the erroneous tax bill in the amount of {$2100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX.

The company knew that my two loans were newly transferred to them and I have never made any payment since the transferring.

Should Sun Trust make sure to let me know or make sure that I am aware of the transferring? On the letter they said they have made a few attempts to call me but unsuccessfully in reaching me.

My name is XXXX XXXX and I currently have a mortgage through J.P Morgan Chase ending in XXXX. They are not the original lender as XXXX XXXX was the original in which it closed XX/XX/XXXX. My complaint and dispute is the run around and unwillingness to perform a XXXX on my property to assess the XXXX ratio for actual value of the property. My current property is located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Fl XXXX. I was given quite an insulting appraisal and disputed it. I even paid for a second appraisal from a second lender. Long story short I ended up having to take the low evaluation to not lose the property since the initial lender has all of the paperwork prepared for closing. Had I not, the seller was going to re-list the property. The property was appraised for {$480000.00} and I currently owe {$420000.00}. The property itself is worth $ XXXX $ XXXX in the $ XXXX range. Thus why I want a XXXX performed in which I expected to be a simple request not an argumentative debate. My complaint is that Chase refuses to perform a XXXX  to assess the actual property value even at my own expense to remove PMI. I am attaching my PMI disclosure from Better Mortgage that I signed at closing. It does state the general dates and numbers for request and/or auto termination of PMI. What it does NOT state is any requirement/s for me to HAVE to perform SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS in order to request and/or pay for a BPO to be performed! This is not right and outright illegal. After telling me on XX/XX/XXXX in an email that I am attaching that I could pay for an evaluation at my expense now everyone that I speak to refuses. They record their calls as most businesses do and have an associate telling me that I could order a BPO over the phone and even billed my checking account for it on XX/XX/XXXX. I have attached my statement showing the charge. There is nothing on my PMI disclosure that mentions the requirement for significant improvements to be performed and/or anything to do with a time frame for borrower requested removal of PMI on the note in under 2 years to request/demand an evaluation of the property/BPO. This to me is a combination of this financial institution just wanting to continue to get rich off of collecting money from as many customers as possible but most IMPORTANTLY the attempt to combine 2 completely different sets of guideline requirements that are not of the same lender and/or to be used concurrently.

On XX/XX/XXXX i called freedom mort. And talked to an agent XXXX about our XX/XX/XXXX payment that was due. On a recorded line he told me that i had XXXX in unapplied funds and assured me that i could use that money to pay for my XXXX payment. I told him that i would call a couple days later to make that payment. On XX/XX/XXXX i called freedom mortgage and spoke to an agent XXXX ( agent ID XXXX ) to make the XXXX payment using the unapplied funds. I paid the XXXX difference and she added the XXXX of unapplied funds to it to complete the XXXX payment. She gave me a conformation number for payment and both of us were aware that this was going to complete the XXXX payment. On XX/XX/XXXX i received a letter in the mail stating that my XXXX payment was never made and that the XXXX dollars wasnt enough for a full payment and that it was placed in a separate account on hold. I called and spoke with XXXX ( AGENT ID XXXX ) i explained to her what happened and after looking through my account she informed me that agent XXXX put the XXXX to interest and not my XXXX payment. XXXX told me that she was going to put in a request to see if the money could be moved but she had to put in a request and that took 2 days to process. The last question that i asked her was in a worse case scenario will this request be denied and she said no it will not be denied. So i got off the phone with her believing what she said was true and i Immediately called freedom mort back and spoke to a supervisor in the escalations dept and spoke to XXXX agent ID XXXX. She immediately told me that basically XXXX who i spoke to in XXXX lied about me not being able to use the unapplied funds for the payment. They were able to pull the recorded phone call and heard him repeatedly telling me that i could use the money. XXXX told me that since my loan was under modification the money couldnt go to my payment that was due. I informed her that i had spoke to many agents from freedom and none of them mentioned this to me. So now due to their mistakes and lies i am behind a whole payment. On XX/XX/XXXX agent XXXX called me and told me that she was working with another supervisor named XXXX the mitigation supervisor and XXXX agent ID XXXX to see if they could do anything but they called me the next day and told me there was nothing that they could do and that i was behind a payment.

I was provided an Option Agreement Estimate based on the company 's Original Agreed Value of my property at {$370000.00} with a equity pay out amount of {$88000.00} prior to closing costs pending an appraisal. Point 's automated valuation models ( AVM ) listed an Appraised Value of {$450000.00}. The property was appraised XX/XX/XXXX. After multiple attempts to inquire on the delay of the appraisal results, the appraisal was submitted to Point on XX/XX/XXXX. The appraisal came back considerably lower than the initial valuation at {$360000.00}. I was informed by Point representative, XXXX XXXX, via email that Point offered the appraiser ( 7 ) seven additional comparable properties in my area for inclusion to the appraisal report to increase my property valuation. The Point representative, XXXX XXXX, informed me the appraiser rejected Point 's request and therefore my application was declined. I acquired another third party appraisal because the initial one was so delayed. I inquired why they did not acquire a second appraisal? I was given no reply. I felt, based on comments by the Point appointed appraiser when on our property, that she may have a XXXX bias and submit a lowball appraisal of our property. I desired to have a comparison valuation to see if my suspicions were valid. A complete and comprehensive appraisal completed XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX showed our property value assessed via AVM at {$480000.00}. And that was based on the County Assessor 's square footage of 1215 and not the full 1882 square foot as specified in the Point appraiser 's calculations. A XXXX representative, XXXX XXXX, also performed a detailed onsite inspection and confirmed the property 's value was easily near XXXX XXXX in value. The appraisal completed by the Point contracted XXXX excluded 2 comparable home sales directly across the street from our property whose sales took place within the last 6-7 months. I informed XXXX XXXX of Point of this. I feel the appraiser concentrated her comparable properties to areas that reflect lower sales prices and a XXXX and XXXX demographic as opposed to including properties within a 1-3 mile radius of our property that reflect a higher XXXX demographic and much higher home values/sales. I also feel the Point 's appraiser 's use of the Cost Approach and the replacement value did not reflect the current market rates for construction materials, construction fees, etc. and was severely under valued and a poor reflection of our property and the improvements made therein. I also hold Point culpable, since they refused to perform a second appraisal and denied my application even though they obviously disagreed with the results of the appraisal report they originally contracted for.\", Company public response='Company disputes the facts presented in the complaint', Company='Point Digital Finance, Inc.', State='FL', ZIP code='33405', Tags=None, Consumer consent provided?='Consent provided', Submitted via='Web', Date sent to company='2022-02-03', Company response to consumer='Closed with explanation', Timely response?='Yes', Consumer disputed?='N/A', Complaint ID='5182053'),\n",

The modification that was offered to me is only a 14 % reduction versus the mandated 25 % reduction required under Covid 19 alm modification for fha loans. In order to achieve the 25 % reduction, mortgagees are required to do a partial claim of the principal if the term extension and rate reduction are insufficient. No partial claim principal reduction was done, despite having an additional {$67000.00} of partial claim funds that could have been applied to reduce the principal and achieve the 25 % reduction. Further, I was supposed to be given 30 days to respond to this letter and was given 12 calendar days, as a response was required by XX/XX/XXXX. I called to inquire abt these discrepancies and was rebuffed and told that this was my only option for loan modification, given no explanation as to why the correct modification guidelines were not followed or employed, and told basically to sign the papers and return them by XX/XX/XXXX or foreclosure proceedings will be initiated. I called again to speak to someone else who then told me that my principal should actually be higher than my original principal that had been owed, and that the {$300.00} savings that they are offering me is sufficient. It is clear that because this loan modification program is not incentivized, that mortgagees will lose out on interest that will result from partial claims on principal balances, because it will reduce the balance on which interest is calculated and accrued, and therefore they are not reducing the principal balance as required, and are forcing the consumer to pay additional interest that under law should be placed under the partial claim loan, which is zero interest.

My loan number is ****. In XX/XX/XXXX, I requested for forbearance for COVID-19 hardship. The forbearance period was from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. In XXXX, I requested for an extension. This extension was approved until XX/XX/XXXX. During the forbearance period I continued to receive late statements and delinquency notices from XXXX XXXX XXXX. Therefore, I constantly called every month to verify that I was still in forbearance. At the end of XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX  discussing next steps when exiting the forbearance period. This document arrived with a lengthy application. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX asking if I needed to complete this document. The customer service representative transferred me to loss mitigation. Loss mitigation stated that they sent the application by accident. However, I had three options to handle the payments that were not made during the forbearance period. The options were, 1 ) I could pay the balance in full 2 ) Arrange a payment plan and 3 ) defer the payments to the end of the loan. At that time, I requested for my complete balance to be deferred. After this, I continued receiving mortgage statements that had a balance that should have been deferred. In XXXX, my balance changed from {$2800.00} to {$1100.00}. My XXXX statement also represented that I had a deferred balance of {$2300.00}. I kept calling regarding the balance being incorrect on my statement and that the complete forbearance was not deferred correctly. At this time, I was reassured that they would process the forbearance extension. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called to check if I needed to make a payment in XXXX, or if the payments resumed in XXXX. Customer service stated I needed to make a payment. Therefore, I made the payment as requested and continued making my payments. I consistently called requesting for the balance to be fixed. I was told by customer representatives that it was escalated and to give it 30 days every call on multiple calls. In the mean time, I was preparing to sale my home to purchase a new home. I seen the regulations for FHA were that you had to make XXXX on time payments after the forbearance period in order to qualify for a home loan. On XX/XX/XXXX I called to request another escalation on the deferral. I was reassured by XXXX that the deferral would be processed in 7 business days. However, that never occurred. At this time, I had applied for my home loan, was pre-approved, had two contracts on my home to sale, and found a new home to purchase. I began to call on a regular basis. Each time, I was told it was being escalated, or sent to a supervisor for the deferral to be processed and the documents to be corrected. By the end of XXXX, nothing had been resolved and I still had a balance on my mortgage statements. Therefore, I was requested to pay my balance in full to have my current loan in good standing. I made my XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX, the remaining {$1100.00} balance ( that was originally supposed to be deferred ) on XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX payment. On XXXX XXXX, I was informed by loss mitigation that they processed the deferral, but I had already paid the balance so there was nothing to defer and that my loan would be reinstated. I have requested for all notes, call logs, and documentation regarding my account from the research department. The majority of these documents I had never seen and some of the items I have requested have not been provided. A forbearance opt-out document ( XXXX ) was in the documents that were provided. This document is dated XX/XX/XXXX and stated that I was out of the forbearance plan and to continue making my monthly payments. The one issue with this document is my forbearance ended in XX/XX/XXXX, not XX/XX/XXXX. Due to the failure of correctly processing the forbearance deferment when originally requested ( or the multiple times after ), contradicting documents, and mortgage statements stating DELINQUENCY or LATE PAYMENTS, I am in a very difficult situation. I am unable to obtain a new home loan unless the documents are corrected, or a letter is drafted on the behalf of Dovenmuehle and/or XXXX XXXX XXXX to address the issues as followed : There were no late payments as the account was in forbearance The forbearance period ended in XX/XX/XXXX The deferral was not processed correctly, or the months that did not process were not done in a timely manner therefore the loan was reinstated once paid in full The payments that did not process for deferral did not have a due date and therefore are not late An overall explanation of the situation from Dovenmuehle and/or XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding the situation The frustration is, I completed everything as needed, and continued my payments when the Forbearance ended. However, the corporations who I relied on to properly handle the Forbearance and Deferment, did not process their responsibilities correctly. Therefore, this is preventing me from obtaining a home loan. Fortunately, I had the sale of my home fall through, or otherwise I would be homeless. However, I currently have three offers on my home that are waiting to be accepted. Also, I am under contract on a home that was supposed to close on XX/XX/XXXX. I have placed earnest money, option fees, appraisal fees, and inspection fees on this home that I will lose if this is not corrected.

Therefore, I denied the partial claim and asked for Post Pandemic Covid Modification which would be a parital claim and reevaluation of the loan thus making the payment lower and interest rate lower. I called a few weeks later to check the status of my request and was told it was successful and to expect to resume payments as of XX/XX/XXXX with a reduced monthly payment from {$2600.00} down to {$2400.00} as well as a reduced interest rate. I was comfortable with this and asked that the paperwork be sent. After waiting an adiditonal 2 weeks, without ant paperowork, I called again and was told that now they anticipated my loan to restart on XX/XX/XXXX ( Not XX/XX/XXXX ) and that my rate was going up and my payment would be {$2500.00} as opposed to {$2400.00}, which is still a reduction but because I am delayed an additional month the negative balance from that extra month as well as escrow got added on and the rates have changed. The bottom line is they are moving the goal post while refusing to send the prpoper paperwork to exit Forebarance. I have seen and read reviews where similar tactics were used in an effort for them to maintain the original payment and rate and therefore change nothing for the customer. I stress that I can not afford to make a {$2600.00} per month payment which is why I asked for the Covid Modification in the first place. If this continues and I have to wait until XX/XX/XXXX to make payments, we will be right back to that payment per month and than some. This predatory behavior is despicable and should be addressed immediately!!! Especially since I am trying to be a stand up person and repay my loan which they are not allowing me to do until it benefits them! I.e If my payments were reduced by {$200.00} they would be loosing money on me and so have now delayed the process on purpose which has now raised my payments and rate which is totally illegal!

Packet is in process and will be submitted. Hello XXXX Management, the entire Advocacy Team for my modification efforts, et al, RE : XXXX Webfile Transcript of Modification Efforts and Investor Rejections : Nationstar Loan Number : XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX Home Loan Number : XXXX and XXXX ID # XXXX -- -COPY ALSO ATTACHED I have attached a partial transcript that identifies communication with the servicer in the past-this is a partial and not full transcript, as the full transcript is more than 100 pages longthe partial transcript is intended to isolate some of the instances of the investors rejection of viable modification option in the past. Please note the particular case where the servicer had approved a modification, I accepted it, and then the investor, XXXX  XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX, rejected a plausible affordable payment solution. I have multiple situations where the servicer had felt a modification was doable, and then the investor, XXXX   XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX, rejected it. Please note in the transcript where I have isolated only a few instances of my efforts to date regarding attempts for modification and at the end of each process, the investor, XXXXI XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX, rejected the proposal for modification. I have attached, a copy, of the entire transcript that shows all my interactions with the servicer and their reporting back to my XXXX web file the repeated decisions, which have been rejections by the investor, XXXX XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX My full XXXX transcript of communication with the servicer is over 100 pages long which I have saved and preserved for future use if needed. The following transcript is a streamlined version of communication to give you an idea of the struggles of attrition during the entire life of this modification process. Please make note wherever the name servicer is mentioned in a row, on the transcript, and the response by the servicer. Please review the attached full transcript as needed to present an even clearer picture of the content of each modification rejection by the investor, XXXX XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX. Please note, on particular case, in the row dated XX/XX/XXXX, after the servicer had extended a modification solution with an affordable payment, after I accepted the solution, the investor XXXX  XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX, again, rejected it, even after the servicer had extended terms. Note in particularly, that the servicer states in the transcript communication on line item dated XX/XX/XXXX, that the investor has the final say in all matters regarding the extension of any affordable modification solution. It was amazing that the servicer, at the time, approved a modification, posted it on my XXXX web file to accept, and not even minutes later, the investor denied the plausible modification solution, which caused the servicer to state in the end, that the decision is at the sole discretion of the investoreven the servicer was surprised and baffled by the investors rejection of a reasonable affordable payment solution. Therefore, in the end this is why, although we will remain optimistic that a solution with an affordable payment can be extended, however, the past history by this investor, XXXX XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX, does not suggest a favorable outcome resulting in an affordable payment solution although I qualify when you look at the calculated housing, back, and front end ratios which were calculated by a reputable housing agency. In the end, we hope this will not be another act of futility by the servicer with no actual decision making powers, who have been willing to extend a reasonable affordable payment solution. But the servicer has had their willingness to extend an affordable solution, rejected by the servicer they work for : XXXX XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX. This is why I am requesting that my advocacy team make an aggressive effort to contact the investor XXXX  Securitizations, master serviced by XXXX XXXX ; they are the ones who have rejected every offer, not the servicer. One of the servicers representatives even demonstrated their frustration that their attempts to extend an affordable payment solution were rebuffed by the investor. Because of their frustration, the servicer identified the following person, XXXX XXXX, as the liaison to the investor team, please contact him, or the other staff members listed below, at the following contact info to determine why they continue to deny and reject reasonable affordable payment modification offers and other programs that would assist us to stay in our home with reasonable solutions to include : all Principal Reduction Programs, options through theHAMP, Hardest Hit Funds, Transcript of Modification Efforts and Investor Rejections XXXX ID XXXX Page 2 of 11 Keep Your Home CA, and other proprietary solutions, etc. All of the aforementioned programs that could have been applied to my situation for an affordable mortgage payment, that we qualified forhave all been denied, and not accepted, but rejected by the investor XXXX XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX ( Please see the indented, highlighted paragraph below, the entire content between the hash lines was sent back to me from XXXX XXXX email addresses automatic reply system.

The lack of payments over the past few years was not our intent nor purpose. We sincerely thought we would have had a modification with an affordable payment within 30 days of visiting XXXX, for modification assistance, the first time we sought them for help with our mortgage. The multiple rejections by the investor team are the reason this modification process is still being pursued, is ongoing, and has become a drudgery. The investors rationale that we received a modification in the past has been obviously demonstrated as no more than a repayment plan that increased our mortgage amount and placed us in a worsened hardship position, that modification repayment plan did not produce an affordable payment! I will provide all of these instances ( of investor rejections ) in my full XXXX transcript via email for my entire advocacy team to review. Please see partial transcript attached below regarding some of the relevant communication from the investor XXXX  XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX as communicated via the servicer -- the powerless fronts for the investor. Please, any member of my advocacy team, you may use this letter as my authorization for you to contact the aforementioned possible front persons with the investor team : XXXX XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX to continue your advocacy for a reasonable solution for an affordable payment modification once and for all.

We were one of the unfortunate borrowers to receive an XX/XX/XXXX ARM loan. The second mortgage became default in early XXXX. Our first mortgage was modified until the XXXX program, and at that time I was under the impression from my ex that the second mortgage had been modified under the first mortgage. He was the one who took care of the finances. Fast forward to XXXX, we split up, I moved out in XX/XX/XXXX and ended up moving back and taking over the mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX. Part of the divorce decree was for me to refinance the property in my name. I started the process right before Covid hit, and when Covid hit I was pushed back because most of my income had been affected. ( I was a waitress, and all the restaurants shut down ) So I started the process again in XXXX. The title company came back and mentioned the second mortgage. Clueless, I asked what I needed to do to fix it, and was told I needed verification of the debt or a statement stating the debt has been fulfilled or resolved. I clearly know nothing as I assumed it was merged. I went to the courthouse and obtained the deeds. Both of the deeds are from XXXX, which has since been bought multiple times. I only have one mortgage that appears on my credit report. Currently XXXX is the mortgage holder for the first mortgage, so I reached out to them. Upon calling them, I was denied access for not verifying the correct address. Curious as I have spoken to them multiple times since I have taken the mortgage over in XXXX. So I logged on to the account and found his address has been changed to receive mailings. So I call XXXX back, verify with his address that is on file and change it back to the property address which I stay at. I ask them to investigate the second details and I provide them with the records I obtained from the courthouse. Then a few days later, the title company is reaching out to him about signing over the deed. This is where the fun begins! This is when I found out about the second mortgage company from him and that he has been receiving the statements all along. I asked for all the information, all he gave me was the name, so I googled, searched and called. While speaking with a representative, I ask when the address on the account was changed. I was notified that it was changed in XXXX and again in XXXX. I asked them to mail me a letter stating such, and receive it. We recently went to court about my not refinancing no show cause and basically the judge didn\\'t listen to a word I said since I didn\\'t have a lawyer. ( Believe it or not, I called multiple local lawyers, apparently everyone started holiday break in XXXX, I just got a call from one of them the other day in regards to my voicemail .... ) Moving forward I contacted them and told them I am to be notified immediately of any and all changes made on the account. I asked them to provide me with when the change occurred and all they said was since it was done \"\" electronically \\'\\' they have no record of when the change was made.

Consumer gave me their number and I immediately started calling. I can not tell you how many times I called Selene probably 30x at least! I started calling around the XXXX of XXXX prettt much begging them to take a payment which had been agreed upon for the loan modification. Selene told me they could not take anything as records had not been downloaded from consumer and they couldnt prove they were my mortgager or that I had a modification. I was told to call back in a couple weeks. This continued I for many months. Then all of a sudden around XXXX they said they had the information and if I wanted to keep my house I had to pay 3 months all at once! At this point I knew we had put in for Covid relief funds thru Vermont and we would be approved. I told them this and every person I spoke to had something different to say! I would ask to speak to a manger and was told no multiple times! They would pass me through and if they did we never received a call back! Finally I knew we weee approved by Vermonts VHFA! But they could t pay bc Selene wasnt boarded with them! They too tried to contact Selene and got no where! Selene then sent our mortgage to a law ex firm for foreclosure. This was news to us we never received a letter from the sheriff saying so or even in the mail! Honestly our loan being sent to a law office probably add things easier for us as they actually responded to our calls and emails! MY DISPUTE IS THAT SELENE charged us for XXXX dollars in attorney fees when it never shouldve gotten this far had they honored the modification in early XXXX. Which I was told by my previous mortgager that was a law and they had to for 90 days! I would like to be reindorsed this money as this was on Selene and not us. As far as I am concerned this place of business should not be on business at ALL! Please see all BBB reviews they are all true! They have put us through a living XXXX And as far as we are concerned I should sue them for more than the XXXX dollars in fees!!!!!! Please take this all into consideration and refund us our law fees of XXXX! Thank you!

They send my monthly statements but the amounts that they claim that I owe are not consistent even though I make my monthly mortgage payment for the amount that it is supposed to be. I am also paid one month ahead on my mortgage payment and because of how they apply the funds they say that I am not a month ahead, even though I am. Also i received a statement from them stating that my mortgage payment went up {$230.00} monthly and then another stating that is went up {$270.00} monthly. They say it is because I have a escrow shortage, however my taxes have not gone up almost {$3000.00}. Also they said I had a escrow shortage of {$1600.00}. I did pay the amount of {$1600.00} for their alleged escrow shortage so my monthly payment would remain the same, also I paid it because I figured that if it proves to not be truthful information then they would legally owe me that amount back, I do not feel comfortable giving them any extra funds due to the fact that nothing is ever applied correctly, but I did pay that as additional directly to my escrow account. I had called them and spoke with a woman by the name of XXXX on XXXX XXXX when I received the first statement saying I would owe a higher amount than usual and was for my XXXX payment. I had already made my XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX, She even got on a XXXX way conference call with my bank that I make the monthly payment from so I could prove that all of my payments were made and that I am paid XXXX month ahead. In XX/XX/XXXX they took my monthly mortgage payment and applied {$420.00} as additional principal which I never asked to have done and who knows what they did with the remainder of my payment, XXXX said that must have caused the issue so she would have a payment audit of my account done, which to date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) has not been performed. Then I have a statement stating that I owe my mortgage payment + a increase to that amount of {$270.00} monthly. and it says it is due XX/XX/XXXX, I have already made not only my XXXX payment but I also have made my XX/XX/XXXX which was withdrawn from my account on XX/XX/XXXX as well as another payment of {$1600.00} to the escrow account additionally. I called to request another escrow analysis be performed to reflect that I paid the shortage, I spoke with a woman named XXXX and then a woman named XXXX. XXXX said she will request the escrow analysis be redone, but claims even though I paid the shortage that the escrow will still be short and that my monthly payment will be at least {$110.00} additionall to my monthly payment that my escrow is actually short. {$2800.00} not {$1600.00} even though that is the amount they said it was short. Then I asked to be transferred back to XXXX because she was helping me to resolve the situation of having my monthly payment get rectified, however I was told that she is available but not responding so they took my contact info. She was supposed to call me back, she has not yet done so. She said that she had to talk to a different department at the time and they were not open yet, which is their bankruptcy dept. We did have to file bankruptcy due to ongoing problems with this mortgage provider, The bankruptcy has been discharged, however XXXX said that the XXXX payment where they only took {$420.00} and applied it to additional principal, when I actually paid my usual payment of {$1400.00}. That it occured when we were in bankruptcy even though the bankruptcy was discharged on XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore that department had to correct it. but we have not been able to get ahold of that department nor has their own representatives. Also during the bankruptcy towards the end twice our lawyer had to contact their lawyer because they said we were behind on our monthly payments, when we were actually 1 month ahead.

I called Caliber Home Loan on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with supervisor XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and told her that I will not be accepting the modification Caliber Home Loan offered because I do not want a deferred principal as part of the modification, and asked if Caliber Home Loan will be willing to change the modification terms to remove the deferred principal and incorporate it into the actual principal amount so that there will be only one loan principal amount on the loan and also to lower the interest rate to make the mortgage payment more affordable. The supervisor XXXX rejected the request. I am requesting that Caliber Home Loan remove the current deferred principal from the terms of the modification and roll it into the loan and also to lower the current interest rate of 3.50 % so to make the mortgage payment more affordable.\", Company public response=None, Company='Caliber Home Loans, Inc.', State='DC', ZIP code='20020', Tags=None, Consumer consent provided?='Consent provided', Submitted via='Web', Date sent to company='2022-04-06', Company response to consumer='Closed with explanation', Timely response?='Yes', Consumer disputed?='N/A', Complaint ID='5412341'),\n",

I had 12 months to refinance removing my ex spouse. Of course 4 weeks after divorce quarantine happened and I was financially negatively affected due to covid 19. I chose the option of forbearance under the cares act. Hopeful it was temporary. In XX/XX/XXXX I started the process I thought to end forbearance only to find out that my ex spouse had filed chapter XXXX  bankruptcy. I was not involved in that in any way. During that process for her I could not do anything with my mortgage including making payments. The end of XX/XX/XXXX there was a judgment and she was no longer in active bankruptcy, she did include this mortgage in her bankruptcy and it was reaffirmed so not to affect my being there as long as I continue to make my payments. XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo drafted a modification to end forbearance. I immediately upon receiving it signed it notarized and returned the modification. My ex-spouse decided to ignore it all together. After months had gone by with no one able to reach my XXXX the modification agreement expired and then I was back to square one. I began the process over again this time without a modification because my intention was to refinance as soon as possible once making the three on TimXXXX payments necessary. That was over 4 months ago that that process was initiated. This time I submitted in the documentation the divorce decree showing my entitlement to the property, a quit claim deed signed and notarized by my ex spouse and handled by my attorney. Of course she also has the chapter XXXX judgment which included Wells Fargo from the year prior. I was told underwriting accepted all the documentation and it was a matter of waiting for the paperwork to be generated. This would allow the forbearance to be lifted without her signature given the documentation provided. After calling Wells Fargo now multiple times learning yesterday on XX/XX/XXXX that the paperwork that was generated was sent to my ex-spouses bankruptcy attorney. Here 's the problem I don't know who that attorney is, he should not have my information my personal information because I did not hire him secondly she is no longer in active bankruptcy therefore there is no need to involve her attorney in any way. Next there was no need to involve her for anybody that may be related to her situation because the quit claim deed along with her chapter XXXX bankruptcy and the divorce decree was enough by law uninvolve her in the process as she only was trying to be a hindrance through ignorance. All that said I initiated the initial process of removing the forbearance nearly 17 months ago. I've been making my regular payments. And desperately want to get this process done so that emotionally I can move on but also interest rates have been at an all-time low and I would like to take advantage of that savings opportunity. I am one income. Any savings is a big safe. I will be saving over {$700.00} a month by refinancing. I can't do that until the forbearance is lifted. Her bankruptcy is not the fault of Wells Fargo and they handled their business there accordingly however this last 4 months and counting is certainly their mistake in the delay. And providing my information to an attorney that is no longer employed by my ex spouse and was never employed by myself. Any information of mine that he receives without my authorization or under any legal pretense is a violation of the privacy act and my rights. This has been a terrible experience start to finish. I want closure and I want to move on. I want to save the money I should already be saving. If the interest rate were to go up a half percent before I refinance from where it has been, that is a cost of over {$30000.00} over the life of the loan to me. This lost opportunity would be squarely on the fault of the lender. I did not find it this process to be that challenging or difficult given I provided all the necessary paperwork documentation and was agreeable through the whole process. At this point however I'm not happy. I've been nice and I've been cordial and I've been understanding and pleasant. That goes away now. It's unacceptable. I would like remediation and this situation brought to a close immediately. Thank you and please if there's anything I'm missing do contact.

This issue has arisen due the fact of an approved forbearance agreement with suspended mo. payments of {$0.00} from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. This was due to the impact of Co-Vid19 hardship. In my paperwork it states that in accordance with the Federal CARES Act the status of the account at the start of the forbearance would be preserved throughout the forbearance period. That if your account was delinquent at the time the forbearance began it would continue in delinquency status that existed at the start of the of the forbearance throughout the forbearance period. If, however, the account is brought to current it would be reported as current throughout the forbearance period. In a letter date XX/XX/XXXX Dovenmuehle required a default payment of {$1800.00} on or before XX/XX/XXXX. I then worked in conjunction with XXXX CARES mortgage relief program through XXXX XXXX XXXX  to have the default cured in the proper time. I was under forbearance from XXXX through XXXX XXXX. I began making payments again and no longer had a need to be under forbearance. However, although I'd begun to make payments through loss mitigation as I'd no longer received a payment booklet and only had past due statements, they continued to have me under forbearance status through XXXX XXXX. I then received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating a recent review of my account showed funds were received for payment due XX/XX/XXXX and that the amount of {$59.00} was posted to the account as unapplied funds and was not applied as a mortgage payment.

I never recieved any notice that this was going to happen. Yhr then told me that I would need to make the second payment to our new mortgager!

I was the able to find them by searching the web and made contact. The new mortgager ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) they told me ..yes my loan was being transferred to them however they would not officially take it over until the XXXX, and that I should make mr payment to Caliber. I called Caliber back and again was told ... no ..I had to pay it to the new loan mortgager as we don't manage you loan anymore. So again I called back to XXXX  and told them again what Caliber had said and again they told me that they do not own my loan yet. So come the following Monday I called Caliber again. I got the same answer. In addition they informed me that because I missed the payment date that I would be no longer eligible for the modification because I didn't meet the modification requirements even though they refuse to take the payment. So I had to wait in for XXXX  to completely have all of my information and officially take over my loan after the XXXX to speak with them. Once I did inform them again what happened and they asked me to send them proof that I was a approved for a modification from caliber. I faxed them the acceptance paperwork from caliber showing that I did qualify and what my trial payments were. A few weeks went by I hadn't heard anything from XXXX  so I contacted them again. Then for me at the time that they didn't receive my paperwork even though I had an fax confirmation. I then re faxed it again to XXXX. Few weeks more went by I heard nothing. I called back to XXXX and basically they told me that caliber sent them a letter saying that they had put me a caliber put me into foreclosure which I was never told that and I shouldn't have been as I was going through the process of them with for the modification. XXXX said they didn't receive very much information from caliber and that they were trying to get more information about it. That they would let me know. Of course nobody ever let me know anything. Then few weeks more went by I called back and they at that time asked me to email or fax their packet for modification or assistance. Sorry did that and also send them again another copy of the approval had gotten from caliber for modification. About 5 weeks went by and we just received a letter now stating that congratulations you are approved to short sale your home and deed in lieu. Congratulations!!! How is that congratulating me that I'm going to lose my house is viewed as a good thing!! I thought they were trying to help me! But now I feel like all they're trying to do is take my property!! Of course I called them really upset. Ask to speak to a manager. Spoke with her at length basically the girl on the phone to answer the phone originally told me I owe it doesn't matter they are going to review it again pretty much that's their decision so there's nothing you can do about it.

       " Row(Date received='2019-10-17', Product='Mortgage', Sub-product='Conventional home mortgage', Issue='Closing on a mortgage', Sub-issue=None, Consumer complaint narrative='- [ ] I went through XXXX to obtain a loan serviced by Bank of America. The home had mold and repairs that needed to be made so we had to go through a rehab procedure. XXXX says online, in literature, at the workshops and in person that there is never a fee for their services, no down payments or closing cost. We began working with them in XX/XX/XXXX and attended three workshops before our process officially began in XX/XX/XXXX and we finally closed XX/XX/XXXX. We had a closing scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX but they could not get things done in time concerning the rehab cost etc. XXXX XXXX ( Rehab Dept ) Director kept changing the amounts after wed already accepted the bid which inflated our loan. XXXX XXXX XXXX, who manages the rehab process, took the inspection report and sent us what needed to be repaired. We were required to get a contractor to give us a bid and once we accepted it then we were to be cleared by XXXX and be able to close. After we agreed with the contractor and signed off, XXXX added things we didnt need like a new roof when the house had a new one and a basement build back that we didnt want or need. The rehab cost went from the {$38000.00} to {$47000.00} to {$57000.00} because the XXXX Director would take off the roof but fluff other numbers and so on. Even after we closed she tried to get us to sign off on a {$66000.00} rehab scope of work which I refused because of the trend of them going up and saying sign this if you want to continue. I found out later that XXXX XXXX XXXX gets a percentage of the final rehab cost so it now makes sense why she kept fluffing the numbers. We only used {$25000.00} though {$57000.00} was figured into our 30 year mortgage. They put around {$28000.00} towards our principle but a couple thousand is still unaccounted for ( {$57000.00} rehab minus {$25000.00} we actually needed to use minus {$28000.00} leaves a few thousand left over ). Then we found out nine months later they charged us the Rehab fee which is supposed to be paid by the lender. The Rehab fee is supposed to be 3 % of the Rehab ( {$57000.00} on one doc ) but they rolled {$1800.00} into our loan which is more than 3 %. Theres also a doc that says the rehab was {$50000.00} and {$1800.00} is still not 3 % of this fee we were never supposed to pay. We were always told the lender pays. When I asked about these discrepancies the Closing Manager, XXXX XXXX asked me, if you knew about the fee would you still have gone through with the loan? I said what does that have to do with anything then he scolded me and accused me of trying to get something from them. When we spoke before this I said I didnt understand the amounts and why we had to bring almost {$19000.00} to close when around {$9000.00} was points we purchased and we were not to pay a closing cost. Without our permission they held {$7700.00} for nine months ( gave me {$1.00} back in interest ). I was told later that due to the confusion at closing they needed to make adjustments and they had to do it that way. All along they say theres no down payment, closing cost and never a fee for their service. The {$7700.00} they held from cash to close overage was placed in the escrow holdbacks to go towards the rehab they said at a later date that we never pre-approved them holding. At one point  they asked for over {$20000.00} in cash to close since we had it in out account. This was decided by Mr. XXXX, the closing manager. There is a contingency of 10 % of the rehab cost which equals about {$5000.00} that got rolled into the loan to cover cost in the event we went over budget. When they surprised us and kept the {$7700.00} cash to close overage and placed it in an escrow holdback account the Rehab Director, XXXX XXXX said it was in case we went over the financed amount which is supposed to be what the 10 % contingency is for so they added an extra {$5000.00} to our loan in case we go over budget. The budget was {$57000.00} and then they felt it was okay to hold {$7700.00} of our money which would give us almost {$65000.00} for rehab and we only needed {$25000.00}. Then we paid out of pocket during the rehab for an HVAC system ( {$7000.00} ) and were not allowed to use our money they had, the {$7700.00} overage they were holding for rehab. I dont understand why our loan had to be inflated again with the contingency fee if they put our overage in escrow for the same purpose. I have been trying for almost a year to have my loan explained. The closing took around six hours after sending us to the bank to get {$22000.00} cash to close but the bank closed early on XX/XX/XXXX to honor the passing of president Bush which the realtor knew about but sent us anyway to buy time. When we returned he and the closing attorney had taken naps per the realtor. Then we were told and given a document saying we needed {$20000.00} cash to close. Mr. XXXX said they were working on the final numbers but in order to close that day we could give the {$20000.00} and Bank of America would cut us a check for any overage. We were asked to sign three different packets with different amounts for our loan and told they were working to straighten out the discrepancies with the lender. One email I received said theyll keep us posted and we were due back {$10000.00} of the cash to close. At one point we decided to leave and the realtor went to get Mr. XXXX and thats when we met him after waiting almost 4 hours we then stayed another 1.5 hours. After XXXX we we told to sign a few more documents and we could wire the money the following day, we just needed the closing date with wet signatures and they had six days to work it out. As we were driving away the closing attorney ran out to our car and had us come in to sign another document. My husband and I worked nights so after working the night before, driving an hour and a half to close, being bounced around for over six hours, driving back, going straight to work, working all night, staying up that next morning anticipating Mr. XXXX call with the final cash to close amount we needed to wire the bank, we finally got to sleep around lunch when Mr. XXXX called to say everything was official. He said he had emails about the overage which was around {$8000.00} ( should have been {$10000.00} ) and he would make sure we got it back. I finally went to sleep thinking we had our home and would be notified concerning the final amounts figured into our loan due to the we have 6 days comments. This never happened. When I was sent an email with the Closing Disclosure and told to sign it in order to close on time, I said the numbers were wrong and was told this was not final but they needed signatures to move forward. I received the email on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX telling me to sign and return by midnight. I saw the email and signed but said it wasnt right. They close at XXXX and there was no one to go over this with me. I called our counselor who never responded to that call. For the next few days the closing coordinator kept sending the same document for me to resubmit because it wasnt legible. She said it was finally received two days prior to close. Then at closing this incorrect document was there for us to sign in our packet. I again said it was wrong and they began trying to fix things. It appears to me they jumbled a few rehab docs together, took out fees and rolled the rest into the loan. When my husband went to the snack machine, our realtor told me how good the loan was even with the discrepancies and I should sign it or the seller will walk. This was the experience the whole time. We were told one thing and railroaded into signing something else. We paid an inspection fee of {$550.00} that was to be credited back since its part of closing and they claim to have no closing cost and told us the lender would credit it to us. They also inflated the PITI which covers mortgage payments during the rehab by {$200.00}. So as it stands for the past two two months a rep from Bank of America has been in contact with XXXX  and had Mr. XXXX call to go line by line and explain what the numbers mean since that didnt happen at closing. When he would get to a point he could not explain, he scolded me and would end the call abruptly. For example, he began to explain the discount points we purchased and said, thats were you purchased seven points. I corrected him and said we only purchased six ( we were not allowed any more ) and he said I have an appointment and got off the phone. I have not heard from him or the Bank of America rep since then and it has been over three weeks. From my calculations we have a couple thousand that was taken from the cash to close that has not been explained and a few thousand unaccounted for that was rolled into the loan. The final loan amount is {$220000.00}. {$57000.00} rehab that was fluffed and rolled into the loan based on BOAs closing documents but about {$50000.00} that Mr. XXXX told me was actually used and in another loan packet. We had around {$19000.00} in cash to close that can not be explained. Ive asked for a breakdown of the escrow holdback and was told by the BOA rep that he would get that to me and had put in a request and thats when communication with him ended. The closing disclosure was changed and signed at closing on XX/XX/XXXX. I have asked since then for clarity. The best explanation I received was from XXXX XXXX Director. She once said it appears they submitted one rehab SOW but used another for the loan causing several thousand dollars difference and she said she would ask that the loan be reassessed. The next time I spoke with her ( after many calls and emails were ignored for along time ) to see if they would redo the loan she said there were no errors and threatened to end the relationship if I speak this way again. Mr. XXXX said he would give back the {$1800.00} plus the interest that I asked for which he said was {$2.00}. Also, the PITI that is rolled into the mortgage to cover the monthly payments while work is being done was not needed because the work took three weeks but they would not clear us to begin although they say work should begin within 30 days after the closing. I was told not to move in until the Director clears me to. They waited until the 5th month to allow the work to begin, didnt pay the contractor until the last month clearing us and we moved in after the PITI was used up. I feel this was strategic as they tried to get me to sign the {$66000.00} SOW that would have included the {$7700.00} overage and made the discrepancies make since. I refused and the back and forth struggle began.', Company public response='Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response', Company='BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION', State='SC', ZIP code='29650', Tags=None, Consumer consent provided?='Consent provided', Submitted via='Web', Date sent to company='2019-10-17', Company response to consumer='Closed with monetary relief', Timely response?='Yes', Consumer disputed?='N/A', Complaint ID='3408829'),\n",

( the bank ), services our conventional mortgage loan. The loan includes a property tax escrow. The town allows quarterly payments, and the bank had always paid the tax payments quarterly. On XX/XX/XXXX, the bank sent a letter stating it would begin paying the property taxes annually for XXXX, rather than quarterly, to get the 2 % discount that the town offers for paying in full. It noted the change could result in an escrow shortage, which if we did not pay in full, the bank would spread over 24 months in the monthly payment. The letter did not disclose how the escrow account payments would change, or if there would be a shortage. In addition, the letter did not give a choice to waive the 2 % discount, and the possible higher escrow shortage, and stay on the quarterly payment cycle with the town taxes. Around XX/XX/XXXX, the bank sent the annual RESPA Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement. The Account Projection table showed there would be the annual tax payment, and that there was now a {$4000.00} escrow shortage. If we did not pay the shortage in full now, the monthly payment for the next 12 months would cover the shortage increasing our total monthly payment {$330.00}. During a phone call with the Tax Dept, the  representative said that it seemed like an error and they would review the issue and contact me. On XX/XX/XXXX, we received the same RESPA disclosure the bank sent in XX/XX/XXXX. The customer representative in the Tax Dept told me that there was no choice in the matter, although they could spread the escrow shortage over a longer period if the payment was not affordable. After checking with her management, she confirmed that we had no choice and the bank would pay the taxes annually. 1. The bank does not disclose the amount of escrow shortage and payment increases when it decides to go to the annual payment cycle instead of the usual quarterly cycle. 2. The bank does not provide the homeowner an option. 3. The bank disclosed that the shortage would be payable over 24 months when the Annual Escrow Disclosure said it would be 12 months, resulting in the substantively increased payment compared with a 24 month collection ; and 4. Customer Service confirmed today that the servicing system is in fact scheduled to collect the shortage over 12 months, not 24. This is an Unfair Practice because we have no choice in the repayment terms of the taxes on our property and we had no information or ability to change how much the escrow would collect to prevent the shortages. In addition, this is a Deceptive Practice, because the XXXX letter advising of the change did not provide the information we needed, it stated it would collect the shortage over 24 months when it would in fact collect it over 12 months. The bank should provide more information when it gives notice of the change in its practice to pay the taxes annually. In addition and most importantly, the bank should offer homeowners the option to pay the 2 %, or remain on the quarterly cycle and lower the escrow shortage, because to do so would be best suited for their budget.', Company public response=None, Company='CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.', State='RI', ZIP code='02864', Tags=None, Consumer consent provided?='Consent provided', Submitted via='Web', Date sent to company='2019-10-18', Company response to consumer='Closed with monetary relief', Timely response?='Yes', Consumer disputed?='N/A', Complaint ID='3407675'),\n",

During the time Roundpoint has held these funds, exceeding my mortgage balance, I have continued to be charged interest on my mortgage. Roundpoint states they are not required to pay interest to me, however, for the funds being held while I am rebuilding my home. It is my understanding that in California, where the property is located and where the mortgage was executed, it is required that money held mortgage escrow accounts must be accruing interest. Today I engaged in more than a half hour of debate with Roundpoint before they finally agreed to release the proceeds being held in excess of my mortgage, in the amount of {$64000.00}. Roundpoint, if doing business in California, should be held accountable for complying with California laws. I should receive interest, compounding from the day the funds were deposited in to this restricted escrow account. I may be reached at XXXX or XXXX.

At the time of closing my mortgage payment was {$4300.00}. Of that {$4300.00} the hazard insurance on the house was {$110.00} and the taxes on it was {$500.00}. The mortgage was pay on time starting XX/XX/XXXX till XX/XX/XXXX when the lender notified me that they did a escrow analysis and my mortgage was projected to be {$6100.00}. My mortgage payments were then adjusted to {$5400.00} for an extended period of time. I paid that amount until XX/XX/XXXX when I has personal issues. The mortgage was eventually modified after several tries and a lawsuit against the lender. Fast forward to today and I have had several structural issues with the house which made me revisit the documents related to the sale of my house. With regards to the lender I filed a complaint with CFPB regarding my loan and as a result they referenced the escrow analysis as if things were normal but then sent me an escrow payment ( which I had never received before for {$900.00} ). This piqued my curiosity so I visited the county treasurer to get the payment history on my taxes and what I found was disturbing to say the least. In XX/XX/XXXX the property taxes paid on my house by the lender {$220.00} which was very low for property taxes. Despite that payment the lender had {$3300.00} escrowed for taxes that it did not pay to the county. The following year with my payment being raised to {$5400.00}, the lender received {$18000.00} in money to be escrowed for taxes. That year along with the previously collected {$3300.00}, the lender was in possession of {$22000.00} in money escrowed for taxes. That year the lender paid {$8100.00} to the county treasurer leaving {$14000.00} in escrow. The following year with my mortgage being raised due to an \"\" escrow analysis \\'\\' another {$9400.00} was collected towards escrow for taxes.

I was told by the sales rep that they had an in house lender ( tripointe connect ) which is partly owned by Loan Depot, and would receive a lender incentive toward closing costs of {$7500.00}. I spoke with a loan officer who quoted me a rate of 2.99 % with no points on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage. We called around to other lenders and all including tripointe connect were within .125 % of each other. We elected to use tripointe connect to take advantage of the {$7500.00} incentive. We were told that the longest lock available was 6 months and would include a one time rate float down that could only be done within 45 days of closing. Until then the rate would be floating. In XXXX we locked the loan for 6 months at 3.25 % with a rate adjustment of .25 % to account for the 6 month lock. Therefore our rate was locked at 3.5 % with an anticipated closing date of XX/XX/XXXX. The 6 month lock gave us extra time to account for any delays. Our lock expiration was XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX We contacted the loan officer to see inquire about excersising the one time float down. We were told that rates had risen and were above 3.5 %. Loan Derpot 's rate sheets were available on the internet and showed that we should have been able to float down to 2.99 % with no points. I asked why we weren't being quoted the 2.99 % rate that we were qualified to have. We were told that the branch manager would contact us to discuss our concerns. When the branch manager called he told us that I wasn't understanding what I was reading. I was in the mortgage business for several years and understood perfectly how to read any rate sheet. Our belief is that we were quoted a low rate to entice us to to use tripointe connect. Once we were contractually obligated to use the in house lender there was no longer an obligation to quote a proper rate. They had no idea that there rate sheets were available to the public. We believe this is an ongoing problem with this lender that could effect hundreds if not thousands of borrowers.

It took 3 months for Fay Servicing to activate the loan so I could continue payments in XX/XX/XXXX. I was under the impression that they were following what I was told from XXXX, deferred payments added to the back of the loan. When I found out they were restructuring the entire loan, I was not happy. My interest rate, payments and loan balance all increased. After 3-4 attempts trying to speak with my loan representative, I was finally able to get him to return my call. He informed me that this is how it works and there was nothing I could do about it, and that I shouldn't have let it go this far and I should have just kept making the payments. His advice was to wait the 5 months and refinance the loan. I waited the 5 months and tried to refinance. That's when I found out that Fay Servicing had reported that I was over 120 days late and my credit report was seriously impacted. I contacted Fay Servicing and asked that it be reviewed and have the credit report adjusted because the Covid Relief was not supposed to impact your credit negatively in any way and I was never late with any payments to Fay Servicing. I was making payments to them even though I was never contacted and informed of the sale of the mortgage and had to search them out on my own. They declined the request, when I asked for an explanation I was told it was declined by the review board, they felt that they had followed the correct procedure and the matter was closed.\", Company public response=None, Company='Fay Servicing, LLC', State='CA', ZIP code='95361', Tags=None, Consumer consent provided?='Consent provided', Submitted via='Web', Date sent to company='2022-02-07', Company response to consumer='Closed with explanation', Timely response?='Yes', Consumer disputed?='N/A', Complaint ID='5196090'),\n",

Specifically I reminded them of my tax exemption which was already in place on this VA Loan. I sent an email to mr cooper 's tax department on XX/XX/XXXX and included copies of 1 ) my tax exemption from the SC Department of Revenue 2 ) a NEW county tax bill in the amount of {$60.00} ( this is my only tax liability which is a local fire tax ) and 3 ) my letter from the VA stating that I'm a XXXX veteran, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and tax exempt from two autos and my home. I also followed up with them numerous times and each time they assured me that it will be taken care of. However, mr cooper paid the erroneous tax bill in the amount of {$2100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. In doing so, it created a negative balance in my escrow account and they sent me a bill to increase my mortgage payment from {$920.00} to an adjusted payment of {$1200.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX. I went to XXXXy county treasurer and was told to call mr cooper tax department and give the the name and tel number of an individual in the treasurer 's office. this way mr cooper could verify that they 1 ) overpaid my tax liability by paying property taxes and 2 ) to confirm that a refund would be sent to them.

I filed a dispute through Suntrust a few weeks ago, my dispute was denied and when I called the dispute center and Suntrust told me they called me and left a message for the sales of my mortgages. But I checked my phone logs and voice messages and it turned out I have never received a call or any voice message from Sun Trust. So I filed a complain about Suntrust and questioned if Suntrust made its best due-diligence to inform me that my loans have been transferred and I had a few missing payments. today I received the response from Sun trust. I will attach the letter here. I have a question about the Sun trust 's response. The company knew that my two loans were newly transferred to them and I have never made any payment since the transferring. The apparent reason is that the borrower might not have received the notification and not aware of the changes. Should Sun Trust make sure to let me know or make sure that I am aware of the transferring? On the letter they said they have made a few attempts to call me but unsuccessfully in reaching me. This is ridiculous! First they told me my late payments wont be reported on my report, and then told me Sun Trust called me and left a voice message to inform my missing payments, and now they told me They have made a few attempts to call me but unsuccessfully in reaching me.

My name is XXXX XXXX and I currently have a mortgage through J.P Morgan Chase ending in XXXX. They are not the original lender as XXXX XXXX was the original in which it closed XX/XX/XXXX. My complaint and dispute is the run around and unwillingness to perform a XXXX on my property to assess the XXXX ratio for actual value of the property. My current property is located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Fl XXXX. I was given quite an insulting appraisal and disputed it. I even paid for a second appraisal from a second lender. Long story short I ended up having to take the low evaluation to not lose the property since the initial lender has all of the paperwork prepared for closing. Had I not, the seller was going to re-list the property. The property was appraised for {$480000.00} and I currently owe {$420000.00}. The property itself is worth $ XXXX $ XXXX in the $ XXXX range. Thus why I want a XXXX performed in which I expected to be a simple request not an argumentative debate. My complaint is that Chase refuses to perform a XXXX  to assess the actual property value even at my own expense to remove PMI. I am attaching my PMI disclosure from Better Mortgage that I signed at closing. It does state the general dates and numbers for request and/or auto termination of PMI. What it does NOT state is any requirement/s for me to HAVE to perform SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS in order to request and/or pay for a BPO to be performed! This is not right and outright illegal. After telling me on XX/XX/XXXX in an email that I am attaching that I could pay for an evaluation at my expense now everyone that I speak to refuses. They record their calls as most businesses do and have an associate telling me that I could order a BPO over the phone and even billed my checking account for it on XX/XX/XXXX. I have attached my statement showing the charge. There is nothing on my PMI disclosure that mentions the requirement for significant improvements to be performed and/or anything to do with a time frame for borrower requested removal of PMI on the note in under 2 years to request/demand an evaluation of the property/BPO. This to me is a combination of this financial institution just wanting to continue to get rich off of collecting money from as many customers as possible but most IMPORTANTLY the attempt to combine 2 completely different sets of guideline requirements that are not of the same lender and/or to be used concurrently. I have read over the XXXX of XXXX, lender disclosure from closing lender, and XXXX XXXX. I know that this is not right and I only agreed to what I SIGNED for at closing.

I am leaving one mortgage company and in the process of going to another ( freedom mortgage ). All of these phone calls and agents that i spoke with are all on a recorded line at freedom mortgage. On XX/XX/XXXX i called freedom mort. And talked to an agent XXXX about our XX/XX/XXXX payment that was due. On a recorded line he told me that i had XXXX in unapplied funds and assured me that i could use that money to pay for my XXXX payment. I told him that i would call a couple days later to make that payment. On XX/XX/XXXX i called freedom mortgage and spoke to an agent XXXX ( agent ID XXXX ) to make the XXXX payment using the unapplied funds. I paid the XXXX difference and she added the XXXX of unapplied funds to it to complete the XXXX payment. She gave me a conformation number for payment and both of us were aware that this was going to complete the XXXX payment. On XX/XX/XXXX i received a letter in the mail stating that my XXXX payment was never made and that the XXXX dollars wasnt enough for a full payment and that it was placed in a separate account on hold. I called and spoke with XXXX ( AGENT ID XXXX ) i explained to her what happened and after looking through my account she informed me that agent XXXX put the XXXX to interest and not my XXXX payment. XXXX told me that she was going to put in a request to see if the money could be moved but she had to put in a request and that took 2 days to process. The last question that i asked her was in a worse case scenario will this request be denied and she said no it will not be denied. So i got off the phone with her believing what she said was true and i Immediately called freedom mort back and spoke to a supervisor in the escalations dept and spoke to XXXX agent ID XXXX. She immediately told me that basically XXXX who i spoke to in XXXX lied about me not being able to use the unapplied funds for the payment. They were able to pull the recorded phone call and heard him repeatedly telling me that i could use the money. XXXX told me that since my loan was under modification the money couldnt go to my payment that was due. I informed her that i had spoke to many agents from freedom and none of them mentioned this to me. So now due to their mistakes and lies i am behind a whole payment. On XX/XX/XXXX agent XXXX called me and told me that she was working with another supervisor named XXXX the mitigation supervisor and XXXX agent ID XXXX to see if they could do anything but they called me the next day and told me there was nothing that they could do and that i was behind a payment. I spoke with 3 freedom mortgage agents on the phone and none of them are telling the truth. They misinformed me that i could use that money for my XXXX payment and even gave me a conformation number.

I was provided an Option Agreement Estimate based on the company 's Original Agreed Value of my property at {$370000.00} with a equity pay out amount of {$88000.00} prior to closing costs pending an appraisal. Point 's automated valuation models ( AVM ) listed an Appraised Value of {$450000.00}. The property was appraised XX/XX/XXXX. After multiple attempts to inquire on the delay of the appraisal results, the appraisal was submitted to Point on XX/XX/XXXX. The appraisal came back considerably lower than the initial valuation at {$360000.00}. I was informed by Point representative, XXXX XXXX, via email that Point offered the appraiser ( 7 ) seven additional comparable properties in my area for inclusion to the appraisal report to increase my property valuation. The Point representative, XXXX XXXX, informed me the appraiser rejected Point 's request and therefore my application was declined. I acquired another third party appraisal because the initial one was so delayed. I inquired why they did not acquire a second appraisal? I was given no reply. I felt, based on comments by the Point appointed appraiser when on our property, that she may have a XXXX bias and submit a lowball appraisal of our property. I desired to have a comparison valuation to see if my suspicions were valid. A complete and comprehensive appraisal completed XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX showed our property value assessed via AVM at {$480000.00}. And that was based on the County Assessor 's square footage of 1215 and not the full 1882 square foot as specified in the Point appraiser 's calculations. A XXXX representative, XXXX XXXX, also performed a detailed onsite inspection and confirmed the property 's value was easily near XXXX XXXX in value. The appraisal completed by the Point contracted XXXX excluded 2 comparable home sales directly across the street from our property whose sales took place within the last 6-7 months. I informed XXXX XXXX of Point of this. I feel the appraiser concentrated her comparable properties to areas that reflect lower sales prices and a XXXX and XXXX demographic as opposed to including properties within a 1-3 mile radius of our property that reflect a higher XXXX demographic and much higher home values/sales. I also feel the Point 's appraiser 's use of the Cost Approach and the replacement value did not reflect the current market rates for construction materials, construction fees, etc. and was severely under valued and a poor reflection of our property and the improvements made therein. I also hold Point culpable, since they refused to perform a second appraisal and denied my application even though they obviously disagreed with the results of the appraisal report they originally contracted for.\", Company public response='Company disputes the facts presented in the complaint', Company='Point Digital Finance, Inc.', State='FL', ZIP code='33405', Tags=None, Consumer consent provided?='Consent provided', Submitted via='Web', Date sent to company='2022-02-03', Company response to consumer='Closed with explanation', Timely response?='Yes', Consumer disputed?='N/A', Complaint ID='5182053'),\n",

The modification that was offered to me is only a 14 % reduction versus the mandated 25 % reduction required under Covid 19 alm modification for fha loans. In order to achieve the 25 % reduction, mortgagees are required to do a partial claim of the principal if the term extension and rate reduction are insufficient. No partial claim principal reduction was done, despite having an additional {$67000.00} of partial claim funds that could have been applied to reduce the principal and achieve the 25 % reduction. Further, I was supposed to be given 30 days to respond to this letter and was given 12 calendar days, as a response was required by XX/XX/XXXX. I called to inquire abt these discrepancies and was rebuffed and told that this was my only option for loan modification, given no explanation as to why the correct modification guidelines were not followed or employed, and told basically to sign the papers and return them by XX/XX/XXXX or foreclosure proceedings will be initiated. I called again to speak to someone else who then told me that my principal should actually be higher than my original principal that had been owed, and that the {$300.00} savings that they are offering me is sufficient. It is clear that because this loan modification program is not incentivized, that mortgagees will lose out on interest that will result from partial claims on principal balances, because it will reduce the balance on which interest is calculated and accrued, and therefore they are not reducing the principal balance as required, and are forcing the consumer to pay additional interest that under law should be placed under the partial claim loan, which is zero interest.

My loan number is ****. In XX/XX/XXXX, I requested for forbearance for COVID-19 hardship. The forbearance period was from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. In XXXX, I requested for an extension. This extension was approved until XX/XX/XXXX. During the forbearance period I continued to receive late statements and delinquency notices from XXXX XXXX XXXX. Therefore, I constantly called every month to verify that I was still in forbearance. At the end of XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX  discussing next steps when exiting the forbearance period. This document arrived with a lengthy application. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX asking if I needed to complete this document. The customer service representative transferred me to loss mitigation. Loss mitigation stated that they sent the application by accident. However, I had three options to handle the payments that were not made during the forbearance period. The options were, 1 ) I could pay the balance in full 2 ) Arrange a payment plan and 3 ) defer the payments to the end of the loan. At that time, I requested for my complete balance to be deferred. After this, I continued receiving mortgage statements that had a balance that should have been deferred. In XXXX, my balance changed from {$2800.00} to {$1100.00}. My XXXX statement also represented that I had a deferred balance of {$2300.00}. I kept calling regarding the balance being incorrect on my statement and that the complete forbearance was not deferred correctly. At this time, I was reassured that they would process the forbearance extension. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called to check if I needed to make a payment in XXXX, or if the payments resumed in XXXX. Customer service stated I needed to make a payment. Therefore, I made the payment as requested and continued making my payments. I consistently called requesting for the balance to be fixed. I was told by customer representatives that it was escalated and to give it 30 days every call on multiple calls. In the mean time, I was preparing to sale my home to purchase a new home. I seen the regulations for FHA were that you had to make XXXX on time payments after the forbearance period in order to qualify for a home loan. On XX/XX/XXXX I called to request another escalation on the deferral. I was reassured by XXXX that the deferral would be processed in 7 business days. However, that never occurred. At this time, I had applied for my home loan, was pre-approved, had two contracts on my home to sale, and found a new home to purchase. I began to call on a regular basis. Each time, I was told it was being escalated, or sent to a supervisor for the deferral to be processed and the documents to be corrected. By the end of XXXX, nothing had been resolved and I still had a balance on my mortgage statements. Therefore, I was requested to pay my balance in full to have my current loan in good standing. I made my XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX, the remaining {$1100.00} balance ( that was originally supposed to be deferred ) on XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX payment. On XXXX XXXX, I was informed by loss mitigation that they processed the deferral, but I had already paid the balance so there was nothing to defer and that my loan would be reinstated. I have requested for all notes, call logs, and documentation regarding my account from the research department. The majority of these documents I had never seen and some of the items I have requested have not been provided. A forbearance opt-out document ( XXXX ) was in the documents that were provided. This document is dated XX/XX/XXXX and stated that I was out of the forbearance plan and to continue making my monthly payments. The one issue with this document is my forbearance ended in XX/XX/XXXX, not XX/XX/XXXX. Due to the failure of correctly processing the forbearance deferment when originally requested ( or the multiple times after ), contradicting documents, and mortgage statements stating DELINQUENCY or LATE PAYMENTS, I am in a very difficult situation. I am unable to obtain a new home loan unless the documents are corrected, or a letter is drafted on the behalf of Dovenmuehle and/or XXXX XXXX XXXX to address the issues as followed : There were no late payments as the account was in forbearance The forbearance period ended in XX/XX/XXXX The deferral was not processed correctly, or the months that did not process were not done in a timely manner therefore the loan was reinstated once paid in full The payments that did not process for deferral did not have a due date and therefore are not late An overall explanation of the situation from Dovenmuehle and/or XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding the situation The frustration is, I completed everything as needed, and continued my payments when the Forbearance ended. However, the corporations who I relied on to properly handle the Forbearance and Deferment, did not process their responsibilities correctly. Therefore, this is preventing me from obtaining a home loan. Fortunately, I had the sale of my home fall through, or otherwise I would be homeless. However, I currently have three offers on my home that are waiting to be accepted. Also, I am under contract on a home that was supposed to close on XX/XX/XXXX. I have placed earnest money, option fees, appraisal fees, and inspection fees on this home that I will lose if this is not corrected.

The company has had a sale date every 30 days since XXXX so according to them this means I can never get a modification. Then last night after sending second complaint with all evidence on complaints number XXXX. The company Nation Star/Mr. Cooper sent me an email, it was encrypted so I filled out my password etc to verify it was them. It then showed me an email that said they had opened a modification request on XX/XX/XXXX and they were going to give me until XX/XX/XXXX to get my papers in. I was so happy ... I thought finally after 4 years they are going to follow the law. Well my sale date was today XX/XX/XXXX. I got up this morning thinking I'm going to call and talk to somebody about email at Nation Star but when I went to my emails, the email they sent me was gone. They took it back. It was just a way for them to trick me and so hopefully they could sell my home without me filing Bankruptcy to stop it. I can now find no trace of it. When I called both XXXX XXXX at Nation Star and Mr Cooper he acted stupid like he couldn't see in their system that they ever sent me anything. It is governor XXXX who advised the law in state of California was to require mortgage lenders to provide an option to request modification. I have not been allowed to. Now they played games with me to try to stop me from filing an emergency bankruptcy petition. I can not tell you how much pain I was in trying to get to courthouse this morning due to the extreme XXXX XXXX  I have. Can't anyone stop them? They have been pulling so many things more than listed here for XXXX  XXXX XXXX. I'm so disheartened that nobody will see what is going on and help. I tried to get XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX legal aid but he gave me this huge list of requirements to get from the investor XXXX XXXX XXXX and they would not provide them in time so at the last minute he said he could not help me. My only way is to suddenly come into money or for XXXX to do a miracle and somebody maybe see this complaint to finally help me. Isn't it illegal for them to fake send me an email saying they have opened a modification request and then rescend it? To actually take the email back from my computer after I have opened it? I cant even find the email ... .they took it back. Please, it is my heartfelt plea. Make Mr Cooper/Nation Star and XXXX XXXX XXXX do the right thing here and give me a modification. I know I qualify because I was a loan officer for years. They should have to give me the house for the 4 years of XXXX that they have dragged me through. I am not to proud to beg.

Packet is in process and will be submitted. Hello XXXX Management, the entire Advocacy Team for my modification efforts, et al, RE : XXXX Webfile Transcript of Modification Efforts and Investor Rejections : Nationstar Loan Number : XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX Home Loan Number : XXXX and XXXX ID # XXXX -- -COPY ALSO ATTACHED I have attached a partial transcript that identifies communication with the servicer in the past-this is a partial and not full transcript, as the full transcript is more than 100 pages longthe partial transcript is intended to isolate some of the instances of the investors rejection of viable modification option in the past. Please note the particular case where the servicer had approved a modification, I accepted it, and then the investor, XXXX  XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX, rejected a plausible affordable payment solution. I have multiple situations where the servicer had felt a modification was doable, and then the investor, XXXX   XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX, rejected it. Please note in the transcript where I have isolated only a few instances of my efforts to date regarding attempts for modification and at the end of each process, the investor, XXXXI XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX, rejected the proposal for modification. I have attached, a copy, of the entire transcript that shows all my interactions with the servicer and their reporting back to my XXXX web file the repeated decisions, which have been rejections by the investor, XXXX XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX My full XXXX transcript of communication with the servicer is over 100 pages long which I have saved and preserved for future use if needed. The following transcript is a streamlined version of communication to give you an idea of the struggles of attrition during the entire life of this modification process. Please make note wherever the name servicer is mentioned in a row, on the transcript, and the response by the servicer. Please review the attached full transcript as needed to present an even clearer picture of the content of each modification rejection by the investor, XXXX XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX. Please note, on particular case, in the row dated XX/XX/XXXX, after the servicer had extended a modification solution with an affordable payment, after I accepted the solution, the investor XXXX  XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX, again, rejected it, even after the servicer had extended terms. Note in particularly, that the servicer states in the transcript communication on line item dated XX/XX/XXXX, that the investor has the final say in all matters regarding the extension of any affordable modification solution. It was amazing that the servicer, at the time, approved a modification, posted it on my XXXX web file to accept, and not even minutes later, the investor denied the plausible modification solution, which caused the servicer to state in the end, that the decision is at the sole discretion of the investoreven the servicer was surprised and baffled by the investors rejection of a reasonable affordable payment solution. Therefore, in the end this is why, although we will remain optimistic that a solution with an affordable payment can be extended, however, the past history by this investor, XXXX XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX, does not suggest a favorable outcome resulting in an affordable payment solution although I qualify when you look at the calculated housing, back, and front end ratios which were calculated by a reputable housing agency. In the end, we hope this will not be another act of futility by the servicer with no actual decision making powers, who have been willing to extend a reasonable affordable payment solution. But the servicer has had their willingness to extend an affordable solution, rejected by the servicer they work for : XXXX XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX. This is why I am requesting that my advocacy team make an aggressive effort to contact the investor XXXX  Securitizations, master serviced by XXXX XXXX ; they are the ones who have rejected every offer, not the servicer. One of the servicers representatives even demonstrated their frustration that their attempts to extend an affordable payment solution were rebuffed by the investor. Because of their frustration, the servicer identified the following person, XXXX XXXX, as the liaison to the investor team, please contact him, or the other staff members listed below, at the following contact info to determine why they continue to deny and reject reasonable affordable payment modification offers and other programs that would assist us to stay in our home with reasonable solutions to include : all Principal Reduction Programs, options through theHAMP, Hardest Hit Funds, Transcript of Modification Efforts and Investor Rejections XXXX ID XXXX Page 2 of 11 Keep Your Home CA, and other proprietary solutions, etc. All of the aforementioned programs that could have been applied to my situation for an affordable mortgage payment, that we qualified forhave all been denied, and not accepted, but rejected by the investor XXXX XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX ( Please see the indented, highlighted paragraph below, the entire content between the hash lines was sent back to me from XXXX XXXX email addresses automatic reply system.

The lack of payments over the past few years was not our intent nor purpose. We sincerely thought we would have had a modification with an affordable payment within 30 days of visiting XXXX, for modification assistance, the first time we sought them for help with our mortgage. The multiple rejections by the investor team are the reason this modification process is still being pursued, is ongoing, and has become a drudgery. The investors rationale that we received a modification in the past has been obviously demonstrated as no more than a repayment plan that increased our mortgage amount and placed us in a worsened hardship position, that modification repayment plan did not produce an affordable payment! I will provide all of these instances ( of investor rejections ) in my full XXXX transcript via email for my entire advocacy team to review. Please see partial transcript attached below regarding some of the relevant communication from the investor XXXX  XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX as communicated via the servicer -- the powerless fronts for the investor. Please, any member of my advocacy team, you may use this letter as my authorization for you to contact the aforementioned possible front persons with the investor team : XXXX XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX to continue your advocacy for a reasonable solution for an affordable payment modification once and for all.

We were one of the unfortunate borrowers to receive an XX/XX/XXXX ARM loan. The second mortgage became default in early XXXX. Our first mortgage was modified until the XXXX program, and at that time I was under the impression from my ex that the second mortgage had been modified under the first mortgage. He was the one who took care of the finances. Fast forward to XXXX, we split up, I moved out in XX/XX/XXXX and ended up moving back and taking over the mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX. Part of the divorce decree was for me to refinance the property in my name. I started the process right before Covid hit, and when Covid hit I was pushed back because most of my income had been affected. ( I was a waitress, and all the restaurants shut down ) So I started the process again in XXXX. The title company came back and mentioned the second mortgage. Clueless, I asked what I needed to do to fix it, and was told I needed verification of the debt or a statement stating the debt has been fulfilled or resolved. I clearly know nothing as I assumed it was merged. I went to the courthouse and obtained the deeds. Both of the deeds are from XXXX, which has since been bought multiple times. I only have one mortgage that appears on my credit report. Currently XXXX is the mortgage holder for the first mortgage, so I reached out to them. Upon calling them, I was denied access for not verifying the correct address. Curious as I have spoken to them multiple times since I have taken the mortgage over in XXXX. So I logged on to the account and found his address has been changed to receive mailings. So I call XXXX back, verify with his address that is on file and change it back to the property address which I stay at. I ask them to investigate the second details and I provide them with the records I obtained from the courthouse. Then a few days later, the title company is reaching out to him about signing over the deed. This is where the fun begins! This is when I found out about the second mortgage company from him and that he has been receiving the statements all along. I asked for all the information, all he gave me was the name, so I googled, searched and called. While speaking with a representative, I ask when the address on the account was changed. I was notified that it was changed in XXXX and again in XXXX. I asked them to mail me a letter stating such, and receive it. We recently went to court about my not refinancing no show cause and basically the judge didn\\'t listen to a word I said since I didn\\'t have a lawyer. ( Believe it or not, I called multiple local lawyers, apparently everyone started holiday break in XXXX, I just got a call from one of them the other day in regards to my voicemail .... ) Moving forward I contacted them and told them I am to be notified immediately of any and all changes made on the account. I asked them to provide me with when the change occurred and all they said was since it was done \"\" electronically \\'\\' they have no record of when the change was made.

Consumer gave me their number and I immediately started calling. I can not tell you how many times I called Selene probably 30x at least! I started calling around the XXXX of XXXX prettt much begging them to take a payment which had been agreed upon for the loan modification. Selene told me they could not take anything as records had not been downloaded from consumer and they couldnt prove they were my mortgager or that I had a modification. I was told to call back in a couple weeks. This continued I for many months. Then all of a sudden around XXXX they said they had the information and if I wanted to keep my house I had to pay 3 months all at once! At this point I knew we had put in for Covid relief funds thru Vermont and we would be approved. I told them this and every person I spoke to had something different to say! I would ask to speak to a manger and was told no multiple times! They would pass me through and if they did we never received a call back! Finally I knew we weee approved by Vermonts VHFA! But they could t pay bc Selene wasnt boarded with them! They too tried to contact Selene and got no where! Selene then sent our mortgage to a law ex firm for foreclosure. This was news to us we never received a letter from the sheriff saying so or even in the mail! Honestly our loan being sent to a law office probably add things easier for us as they actually responded to our calls and emails! MY DISPUTE IS THAT SELENE charged us for XXXX dollars in attorney fees when it never shouldve gotten this far had they honored the modification in early XXXX. Which I was told by my previous mortgager that was a law and they had to for 90 days! I would like to be reindorsed this money as this was on Selene and not us. As far as I am concerned this place of business should not be on business at ALL! Please see all BBB reviews they are all true! They have put us through a living XXXX And as far as we are concerned I should sue them for more than the XXXX dollars in fees!!!!!! Please take this all into consideration and refund us our law fees of XXXX! Thank you!

They send my monthly statements but the amounts that they claim that I owe are not consistent even though I make my monthly mortgage payment for the amount that it is supposed to be. I am also paid one month ahead on my mortgage payment and because of how they apply the funds they say that I am not a month ahead, even though I am. Also i received a statement from them stating that my mortgage payment went up {$230.00} monthly and then another stating that is went up {$270.00} monthly. They say it is because I have a escrow shortage, however my taxes have not gone up almost {$3000.00}. Also they said I had a escrow shortage of {$1600.00}. I did pay the amount of {$1600.00} for their alleged escrow shortage so my monthly payment would remain the same, also I paid it because I figured that if it proves to not be truthful information then they would legally owe me that amount back, I do not feel comfortable giving them any extra funds due to the fact that nothing is ever applied correctly, but I did pay that as additional directly to my escrow account. I had called them and spoke with a woman by the name of XXXX on XXXX XXXX when I received the first statement saying I would owe a higher amount than usual and was for my XXXX payment. I had already made my XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX, She even got on a XXXX way conference call with my bank that I make the monthly payment from so I could prove that all of my payments were made and that I am paid XXXX month ahead. In XX/XX/XXXX they took my monthly mortgage payment and applied {$420.00} as additional principal which I never asked to have done and who knows what they did with the remainder of my payment, XXXX said that must have caused the issue so she would have a payment audit of my account done, which to date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) has not been performed. Then I have a statement stating that I owe my mortgage payment + a increase to that amount of {$270.00} monthly. and it says it is due XX/XX/XXXX, I have already made not only my XXXX payment but I also have made my XX/XX/XXXX which was withdrawn from my account on XX/XX/XXXX as well as another payment of {$1600.00} to the escrow account additionally. I called to request another escrow analysis be performed to reflect that I paid the shortage, I spoke with a woman named XXXX and then a woman named XXXX. XXXX said she will request the escrow analysis be redone, but claims even though I paid the shortage that the escrow will still be short and that my monthly payment will be at least {$110.00} additionall to my monthly payment that my escrow is actually short. {$2800.00} not {$1600.00} even though that is the amount they said it was short. Then I asked to be transferred back to XXXX because she was helping me to resolve the situation of having my monthly payment get rectified, however I was told that she is available but not responding so they took my contact info. She was supposed to call me back, she has not yet done so. She said that she had to talk to a different department at the time and they were not open yet, which is their bankruptcy dept. We did have to file bankruptcy due to ongoing problems with this mortgage provider, The bankruptcy has been discharged, however XXXX said that the XXXX payment where they only took {$420.00} and applied it to additional principal, when I actually paid my usual payment of {$1400.00}. That it occured when we were in bankruptcy even though the bankruptcy was discharged on XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore that department had to correct it. but we have not been able to get ahold of that department nor has their own representatives. Also during the bankruptcy towards the end twice our lawyer had to contact their lawyer because they said we were behind on our monthly payments, when we were actually 1 month ahead.

I called Caliber Home Loan on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with supervisor XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and told her that I will not be accepting the modification Caliber Home Loan offered because I do not want a deferred principal as part of the modification, and asked if Caliber Home Loan will be willing to change the modification terms to remove the deferred principal and incorporate it into the actual principal amount so that there will be only one loan principal amount on the loan and also to lower the interest rate to make the mortgage payment more affordable. The supervisor XXXX rejected the request. I am requesting that Caliber Home Loan remove the current deferred principal from the terms of the modification and roll it into the loan and also to lower the current interest rate of 3.50 % so to make the mortgage payment more affordable.\", Company public response=None, Company='Caliber Home Loans, Inc.', State='DC', ZIP code='20020', Tags=None, Consumer consent provided?='Consent provided', Submitted via='Web', Date sent to company='2022-04-06', Company response to consumer='Closed with explanation', Timely response?='Yes', Consumer disputed?='N/A', Complaint ID='5412341'),\n",

I had 12 months to refinance removing my ex spouse. Of course 4 weeks after divorce quarantine happened and I was financially negatively affected due to covid 19. I chose the option of forbearance under the cares act. Hopeful it was temporary. In XX/XX/XXXX I started the process I thought to end forbearance only to find out that my ex spouse had filed chapter XXXX  bankruptcy. I was not involved in that in any way. During that process for her I could not do anything with my mortgage including making payments. The end of XX/XX/XXXX there was a judgment and she was no longer in active bankruptcy, she did include this mortgage in her bankruptcy and it was reaffirmed so not to affect my being there as long as I continue to make my payments. XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo drafted a modification to end forbearance. I immediately upon receiving it signed it notarized and returned the modification. My ex-spouse decided to ignore it all together. After months had gone by with no one able to reach my XXXX the modification agreement expired and then I was back to square one. I began the process over again this time without a modification because my intention was to refinance as soon as possible once making the three on TimXXXX payments necessary. That was over 4 months ago that that process was initiated. This time I submitted in the documentation the divorce decree showing my entitlement to the property, a quit claim deed signed and notarized by my ex spouse and handled by my attorney. Of course she also has the chapter XXXX judgment which included Wells Fargo from the year prior. I was told underwriting accepted all the documentation and it was a matter of waiting for the paperwork to be generated. This would allow the forbearance to be lifted without her signature given the documentation provided. After calling Wells Fargo now multiple times learning yesterday on XX/XX/XXXX that the paperwork that was generated was sent to my ex-spouses bankruptcy attorney. Here 's the problem I don't know who that attorney is, he should not have my information my personal information because I did not hire him secondly she is no longer in active bankruptcy therefore there is no need to involve her attorney in any way. Next there was no need to involve her for anybody that may be related to her situation because the quit claim deed along with her chapter XXXX bankruptcy and the divorce decree was enough by law uninvolve her in the process as she only was trying to be a hindrance through ignorance. All that said I initiated the initial process of removing the forbearance nearly 17 months ago. I've been making my regular payments. And desperately want to get this process done so that emotionally I can move on but also interest rates have been at an all-time low and I would like to take advantage of that savings opportunity. I am one income. Any savings is a big safe. I will be saving over {$700.00} a month by refinancing. I can't do that until the forbearance is lifted. Her bankruptcy is not the fault of Wells Fargo and they handled their business there accordingly however this last 4 months and counting is certainly their mistake in the delay. And providing my information to an attorney that is no longer employed by my ex spouse and was never employed by myself. Any information of mine that he receives without my authorization or under any legal pretense is a violation of the privacy act and my rights. This has been a terrible experience start to finish. I want closure and I want to move on. I want to save the money I should already be saving. If the interest rate were to go up a half percent before I refinance from where it has been, that is a cost of over {$30000.00} over the life of the loan to me. This lost opportunity would be squarely on the fault of the lender. I did not find it this process to be that challenging or difficult given I provided all the necessary paperwork documentation and was agreeable through the whole process. At this point however I'm not happy. I've been nice and I've been cordial and I've been understanding and pleasant. That goes away now. It's unacceptable. I would like remediation and this situation brought to a close immediately. Thank you and please if there's anything I'm missing do contact.

This issue has arisen due the fact of an approved forbearance agreement with suspended mo. payments of {$0.00} from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. This was due to the impact of Co-Vid19 hardship. In my paperwork it states that in accordance with the Federal CARES Act the status of the account at the start of the forbearance would be preserved throughout the forbearance period. That if your account was delinquent at the time the forbearance began it would continue in delinquency status that existed at the start of the of the forbearance throughout the forbearance period. If, however, the account is brought to current it would be reported as current throughout the forbearance period. In a letter date XX/XX/XXXX Dovenmuehle required a default payment of {$1800.00} on or before XX/XX/XXXX. I then worked in conjunction with XXXX CARES mortgage relief program through XXXX XXXX XXXX  to have the default cured in the proper time. I was under forbearance from XXXX through XXXX XXXX. I began making payments again and no longer had a need to be under forbearance. However, although I'd begun to make payments through loss mitigation as I'd no longer received a payment booklet and only had past due statements, they continued to have me under forbearance status through XXXX XXXX. I then received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating a recent review of my account showed funds were received for payment due XX/XX/XXXX and that the amount of {$59.00} was posted to the account as unapplied funds and was not applied as a mortgage payment.

I never recieved any notice that this was going to happen. Yhr then told me that I would need to make the second payment to our new mortgager!

I was the able to find them by searching the web and made contact. The new mortgager ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) they told me ..yes my loan was being transferred to them however they would not officially take it over until the XXXX, and that I should make mr payment to Caliber. I called Caliber back and again was told ... no ..I had to pay it to the new loan mortgager as we don't manage you loan anymore. So again I called back to XXXX  and told them again what Caliber had said and again they told me that they do not own my loan yet. So come the following Monday I called Caliber again. I got the same answer. In addition they informed me that because I missed the payment date that I would be no longer eligible for the modification because I didn't meet the modification requirements even though they refuse to take the payment. So I had to wait in for XXXX  to completely have all of my information and officially take over my loan after the XXXX to speak with them. Once I did inform them again what happened and they asked me to send them proof that I was a approved for a modification from caliber. I faxed them the acceptance paperwork from caliber showing that I did qualify and what my trial payments were. A few weeks went by I hadn't heard anything from XXXX  so I contacted them again. Then for me at the time that they didn't receive my paperwork even though I had an fax confirmation. I then re faxed it again to XXXX. Few weeks more went by I heard nothing. I called back to XXXX and basically they told me that caliber sent them a letter saying that they had put me a caliber put me into foreclosure which I was never told that and I shouldn't have been as I was going through the process of them with for the modification. XXXX said they didn't receive very much information from caliber and that they were trying to get more information about it. That they would let me know. Of course nobody ever let me know anything. Then few weeks more went by I called back and they at that time asked me to email or fax their packet for modification or assistance. Sorry did that and also send them again another copy of the approval had gotten from caliber for modification. About 5 weeks went by and we just received a letter now stating that congratulations you are approved to short sale your home and deed in lieu. Congratulations!!! How is that congratulating me that I'm going to lose my house is viewed as a good thing!! I thought they were trying to help me! But now I feel like all they're trying to do is take my property!! Of course I called them really upset. Ask to speak to a manager. Spoke with her at length basically the girl on the phone to answer the phone originally told me I owe it doesn't matter they are going to review it again pretty much that's their decision so there's nothing you can do about it.

       " Row(Date received='2019-10-17', Product='Mortgage', Sub-product='Conventional home mortgage', Issue='Closing on a mortgage', Sub-issue=None, Consumer complaint narrative='- [ ] I went through XXXX to obtain a loan serviced by Bank of America. The home had mold and repairs that needed to be made so we had to go through a rehab procedure. XXXX says online, in literature, at the workshops and in person that there is never a fee for their services, no down payments or closing cost. We began working with them in XX/XX/XXXX and attended three workshops before our process officially began in XX/XX/XXXX and we finally closed XX/XX/XXXX. We had a closing scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX but they could not get things done in time concerning the rehab cost etc. XXXX XXXX ( Rehab Dept ) Director kept changing the amounts after wed already accepted the bid which inflated our loan. XXXX XXXX XXXX, who manages the rehab process, took the inspection report and sent us what needed to be repaired. We were required to get a contractor to give us a bid and once we accepted it then we were to be cleared by XXXX and be able to close. After we agreed with the contractor and signed off, XXXX added things we didnt need like a new roof when the house had a new one and a basement build back that we didnt want or need. The rehab cost went from the {$38000.00} to {$47000.00} to {$57000.00} because the XXXX Director would take off the roof but fluff other numbers and so on. Even after we closed she tried to get us to sign off on a {$66000.00} rehab scope of work which I refused because of the trend of them going up and saying sign this if you want to continue. I found out later that XXXX XXXX XXXX gets a percentage of the final rehab cost so it now makes sense why she kept fluffing the numbers. We only used {$25000.00} though {$57000.00} was figured into our 30 year mortgage. They put around {$28000.00} towards our principle but a couple thousand is still unaccounted for ( {$57000.00} rehab minus {$25000.00} we actually needed to use minus {$28000.00} leaves a few thousand left over ). Then we found out nine months later they charged us the Rehab fee which is supposed to be paid by the lender. The Rehab fee is supposed to be 3 % of the Rehab ( {$57000.00} on one doc ) but they rolled {$1800.00} into our loan which is more than 3 %. Theres also a doc that says the rehab was {$50000.00} and {$1800.00} is still not 3 % of this fee we were never supposed to pay. We were always told the lender pays. When I asked about these discrepancies the Closing Manager, XXXX XXXX asked me, if you knew about the fee would you still have gone through with the loan? I said what does that have to do with anything then he scolded me and accused me of trying to get something from them. When we spoke before this I said I didnt understand the amounts and why we had to bring almost {$19000.00} to close when around {$9000.00} was points we purchased and we were not to pay a closing cost. Without our permission they held {$7700.00} for nine months ( gave me {$1.00} back in interest ). I was told later that due to the confusion at closing they needed to make adjustments and they had to do it that way. All along they say theres no down payment, closing cost and never a fee for their service. The {$7700.00} they held from cash to close overage was placed in the escrow holdbacks to go towards the rehab they said at a later date that we never pre-approved them holding. At one point  they asked for over {$20000.00} in cash to close since we had it in out account. This was decided by Mr. XXXX, the closing manager. There is a contingency of 10 % of the rehab cost which equals about {$5000.00} that got rolled into the loan to cover cost in the event we went over budget. When they surprised us and kept the {$7700.00} cash to close overage and placed it in an escrow holdback account the Rehab Director, XXXX XXXX said it was in case we went over the financed amount which is supposed to be what the 10 % contingency is for so they added an extra {$5000.00} to our loan in case we go over budget. The budget was {$57000.00} and then they felt it was okay to hold {$7700.00} of our money which would give us almost {$65000.00} for rehab and we only needed {$25000.00}. Then we paid out of pocket during the rehab for an HVAC system ( {$7000.00} ) and were not allowed to use our money they had, the {$7700.00} overage they were holding for rehab. I dont understand why our loan had to be inflated again with the contingency fee if they put our overage in escrow for the same purpose. I have been trying for almost a year to have my loan explained. The closing took around six hours after sending us to the bank to get {$22000.00} cash to close but the bank closed early on XX/XX/XXXX to honor the passing of president Bush which the realtor knew about but sent us anyway to buy time. When we returned he and the closing attorney had taken naps per the realtor. Then we were told and given a document saying we needed {$20000.00} cash to close. Mr. XXXX said they were working on the final numbers but in order to close that day we could give the {$20000.00} and Bank of America would cut us a check for any overage. We were asked to sign three different packets with different amounts for our loan and told they were working to straighten out the discrepancies with the lender. One email I received said theyll keep us posted and we were due back {$10000.00} of the cash to close. At one point we decided to leave and the realtor went to get Mr. XXXX and thats when we met him after waiting almost 4 hours we then stayed another 1.5 hours. After XXXX we we told to sign a few more documents and we could wire the money the following day, we just needed the closing date with wet signatures and they had six days to work it out. As we were driving away the closing attorney ran out to our car and had us come in to sign another document. My husband and I worked nights so after working the night before, driving an hour and a half to close, being bounced around for over six hours, driving back, going straight to work, working all night, staying up that next morning anticipating Mr. XXXX call with the final cash to close amount we needed to wire the bank, we finally got to sleep around lunch when Mr. XXXX called to say everything was official. He said he had emails about the overage which was around {$8000.00} ( should have been {$10000.00} ) and he would make sure we got it back. I finally went to sleep thinking we had our home and would be notified concerning the final amounts figured into our loan due to the we have 6 days comments. This never happened. When I was sent an email with the Closing Disclosure and told to sign it in order to close on time, I said the numbers were wrong and was told this was not final but they needed signatures to move forward. I received the email on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX telling me to sign and return by midnight. I saw the email and signed but said it wasnt right. They close at XXXX and there was no one to go over this with me. I called our counselor who never responded to that call. For the next few days the closing coordinator kept sending the same document for me to resubmit because it wasnt legible. She said it was finally received two days prior to close. Then at closing this incorrect document was there for us to sign in our packet. I again said it was wrong and they began trying to fix things. It appears to me they jumbled a few rehab docs together, took out fees and rolled the rest into the loan. When my husband went to the snack machine, our realtor told me how good the loan was even with the discrepancies and I should sign it or the seller will walk. This was the experience the whole time. We were told one thing and railroaded into signing something else. We paid an inspection fee of {$550.00} that was to be credited back since its part of closing and they claim to have no closing cost and told us the lender would credit it to us. They also inflated the PITI which covers mortgage payments during the rehab by {$200.00}. So as it stands for the past two two months a rep from Bank of America has been in contact with XXXX  and had Mr. XXXX call to go line by line and explain what the numbers mean since that didnt happen at closing. When he would get to a point he could not explain, he scolded me and would end the call abruptly. For example, he began to explain the discount points we purchased and said, thats were you purchased seven points. I corrected him and said we only purchased six ( we were not allowed any more ) and he said I have an appointment and got off the phone. I have not heard from him or the Bank of America rep since then and it has been over three weeks. From my calculations we have a couple thousand that was taken from the cash to close that has not been explained and a few thousand unaccounted for that was rolled into the loan. The final loan amount is {$220000.00}. {$57000.00} rehab that was fluffed and rolled into the loan based on BOAs closing documents but about {$50000.00} that Mr. XXXX told me was actually used and in another loan packet. We had around {$19000.00} in cash to close that can not be explained. Ive asked for a breakdown of the escrow holdback and was told by the BOA rep that he would get that to me and had put in a request and thats when communication with him ended. The closing disclosure was changed and signed at closing on XX/XX/XXXX. I have asked since then for clarity. The best explanation I received was from XXXX XXXX Director. She once said it appears they submitted one rehab SOW but used another for the loan causing several thousand dollars difference and she said she would ask that the loan be reassessed. The next time I spoke with her ( after many calls and emails were ignored for along time ) to see if they would redo the loan she said there were no errors and threatened to end the relationship if I speak this way again. Mr. XXXX said he would give back the {$1800.00} plus the interest that I asked for which he said was {$2.00}. Also, the PITI that is rolled into the mortgage to cover the monthly payments while work is being done was not needed because the work took three weeks but they would not clear us to begin although they say work should begin within 30 days after the closing. I was told not to move in until the Director clears me to. They waited until the 5th month to allow the work to begin, didnt pay the contractor until the last month clearing us and we moved in after the PITI was used up. I feel this was strategic as they tried to get me to sign the {$66000.00} SOW that would have included the {$7700.00} overage and made the discrepancies make since. I refused and the back and forth struggle began.', Company public response='Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response', Company='BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION', State='SC', ZIP code='29650', Tags=None, Consumer consent provided?='Consent provided', Submitted via='Web', Date sent to company='2019-10-17', Company response to consumer='Closed with monetary relief', Timely response?='Yes', Consumer disputed?='N/A', Complaint ID='3408829'),\n",

( the bank ), services our conventional mortgage loan. The loan includes a property tax escrow. The town allows quarterly payments, and the bank had always paid the tax payments quarterly. On XX/XX/XXXX, the bank sent a letter stating it would begin paying the property taxes annually for XXXX, rather than quarterly, to get the 2 % discount that the town offers for paying in full. It noted the change could result in an escrow shortage, which if we did not pay in full, the bank would spread over 24 months in the monthly payment. The letter did not disclose how the escrow account payments would change, or if there would be a shortage. In addition, the letter did not give a choice to waive the 2 % discount, and the possible higher escrow shortage, and stay on the quarterly payment cycle with the town taxes. Around XX/XX/XXXX, the bank sent the annual RESPA Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement. The Account Projection table showed there would be the annual tax payment, and that there was now a {$4000.00} escrow shortage. If we did not pay the shortage in full now, the monthly payment for the next 12 months would cover the shortage increasing our total monthly payment {$330.00}. During a phone call with the Tax Dept, the  representative said that it seemed like an error and they would review the issue and contact me. On XX/XX/XXXX, we received the same RESPA disclosure the bank sent in XX/XX/XXXX. The customer representative in the Tax Dept told me that there was no choice in the matter, although they could spread the escrow shortage over a longer period if the payment was not affordable. After checking with her management, she confirmed that we had no choice and the bank would pay the taxes annually. 1. The bank does not disclose the amount of escrow shortage and payment increases when it decides to go to the annual payment cycle instead of the usual quarterly cycle. 2. The bank does not provide the homeowner an option. 3. The bank disclosed that the shortage would be payable over 24 months when the Annual Escrow Disclosure said it would be 12 months, resulting in the substantively increased payment compared with a 24 month collection ; and 4. Customer Service confirmed today that the servicing system is in fact scheduled to collect the shortage over 12 months, not 24. This is an Unfair Practice because we have no choice in the repayment terms of the taxes on our property and we had no information or ability to change how much the escrow would collect to prevent the shortages. In addition, this is a Deceptive Practice, because the XXXX letter advising of the change did not provide the information we needed, it stated it would collect the shortage over 24 months when it would in fact collect it over 12 months. The bank should provide more information when it gives notice of the change in its practice to pay the taxes annually. In addition and most importantly, the bank should offer homeowners the option to pay the 2 %, or remain on the quarterly cycle and lower the escrow shortage, because to do so would be best suited for their budget.', Company public response=None, Company='CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.', State='RI', ZIP code='02864', Tags=None, Consumer consent provided?='Consent provided', Submitted via='Web', Date sent to company='2019-10-18', Company response to consumer='Closed with monetary relief', Timely response?='Yes', Consumer disputed?='N/A', Complaint ID='3407675'),\n",

During the time Roundpoint has held these funds, exceeding my mortgage balance, I have continued to be charged interest on my mortgage. Roundpoint states they are not required to pay interest to me, however, for the funds being held while I am rebuilding my home. It is my understanding that in California, where the property is located and where the mortgage was executed, it is required that money held mortgage escrow accounts must be accruing interest. Today I engaged in more than a half hour of debate with Roundpoint before they finally agreed to release the proceeds being held in excess of my mortgage, in the amount of {$64000.00}. Roundpoint, if doing business in California, should be held accountable for complying with California laws. I should receive interest, compounding from the day the funds were deposited in to this restricted escrow account. I may be reached at XXXX or XXXX.

At the time of closing my mortgage payment was {$4300.00}. Of that {$4300.00} the hazard insurance on the house was {$110.00} and the taxes on it was {$500.00}. The mortgage was pay on time starting XX/XX/XXXX till XX/XX/XXXX when the lender notified me that they did a escrow analysis and my mortgage was projected to be {$6100.00}. My mortgage payments were then adjusted to {$5400.00} for an extended period of time. I paid that amount until XX/XX/XXXX when I has personal issues. The mortgage was eventually modified after several tries and a lawsuit against the lender. Fast forward to today and I have had several structural issues with the house which made me revisit the documents related to the sale of my house. With regards to the lender I filed a complaint with CFPB regarding my loan and as a result they referenced the escrow analysis as if things were normal but then sent me an escrow payment ( which I had never received before for {$900.00} ). This piqued my curiosity so I visited the county treasurer to get the payment history on my taxes and what I found was disturbing to say the least. In XX/XX/XXXX the property taxes paid on my house by the lender {$220.00} which was very low for property taxes. Despite that payment the lender had {$3300.00} escrowed for taxes that it did not pay to the county. The following year with my payment being raised to {$5400.00}, the lender received {$18000.00} in money to be escrowed for taxes. That year along with the previously collected {$3300.00}, the lender was in possession of {$22000.00} in money escrowed for taxes. That year the lender paid {$8100.00} to the county treasurer leaving {$14000.00} in escrow. The following year with my mortgage being raised due to an \"\" escrow analysis \\'\\' another {$9400.00} was collected towards escrow for taxes.

I was told by the sales rep that they had an in house lender ( tripointe connect ) which is partly owned by Loan Depot, and would receive a lender incentive toward closing costs of {$7500.00}. I spoke with a loan officer who quoted me a rate of 2.99 % with no points on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage. We called around to other lenders and all including tripointe connect were within .125 % of each other. We elected to use tripointe connect to take advantage of the {$7500.00} incentive. We were told that the longest lock available was 6 months and would include a one time rate float down that could only be done within 45 days of closing. Until then the rate would be floating. In XXXX we locked the loan for 6 months at 3.25 % with a rate adjustment of .25 % to account for the 6 month lock. Therefore our rate was locked at 3.5 % with an anticipated closing date of XX/XX/XXXX. The 6 month lock gave us extra time to account for any delays. Our lock expiration was XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX We contacted the loan officer to see inquire about excersising the one time float down. We were told that rates had risen and were above 3.5 %. Loan Derpot 's rate sheets were available on the internet and showed that we should have been able to float down to 2.99 % with no points. I asked why we weren't being quoted the 2.99 % rate that we were qualified to have. We were told that the branch manager would contact us to discuss our concerns. When the branch manager called he told us that I wasn't understanding what I was reading. I was in the mortgage business for several years and understood perfectly how to read any rate sheet. Our belief is that we were quoted a low rate to entice us to to use tripointe connect. Once we were contractually obligated to use the in house lender there was no longer an obligation to quote a proper rate. They had no idea that there rate sheets were available to the public. We believe this is an ongoing problem with this lender that could effect hundreds if not thousands of borrowers.

It took 3 months for Fay Servicing to activate the loan so I could continue payments in XX/XX/XXXX. I was under the impression that they were following what I was told from XXXX, deferred payments added to the back of the loan. When I found out they were restructuring the entire loan, I was not happy. My interest rate, payments and loan balance all increased. After 3-4 attempts trying to speak with my loan representative, I was finally able to get him to return my call. He informed me that this is how it works and there was nothing I could do about it, and that I shouldn't have let it go this far and I should have just kept making the payments. His advice was to wait the 5 months and refinance the loan. I waited the 5 months and tried to refinance. That's when I found out that Fay Servicing had reported that I was over 120 days late and my credit report was seriously impacted. I contacted Fay Servicing and asked that it be reviewed and have the credit report adjusted because the Covid Relief was not supposed to impact your credit negatively in any way and I was never late with any payments to Fay Servicing. I was making payments to them even though I was never contacted and informed of the sale of the mortgage and had to search them out on my own. They declined the request, when I asked for an explanation I was told it was declined by the review board, they felt that they had followed the correct procedure and the matter was closed.\", Company public response=None, Company='Fay Servicing, LLC', State='CA', ZIP code='95361', Tags=None, Consumer consent provided?='Consent provided', Submitted via='Web', Date sent to company='2022-02-07', Company response to consumer='Closed with explanation', Timely response?='Yes', Consumer disputed?='N/A', Complaint ID='5196090'),\n",

Specifically I reminded them of my tax exemption which was already in place on this VA Loan. I sent an email to mr cooper 's tax department on XX/XX/XXXX and included copies of 1 ) my tax exemption from the SC Department of Revenue 2 ) a NEW county tax bill in the amount of {$60.00} ( this is my only tax liability which is a local fire tax ) and 3 ) my letter from the VA stating that I'm a XXXX veteran, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and tax exempt from two autos and my home. I also followed up with them numerous times and each time they assured me that it will be taken care of. However, mr cooper paid the erroneous tax bill in the amount of {$2100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. In doing so, it created a negative balance in my escrow account and they sent me a bill to increase my mortgage payment from {$920.00} to an adjusted payment of {$1200.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX. I went to XXXXy county treasurer and was told to call mr cooper tax department and give the the name and tel number of an individual in the treasurer 's office. this way mr cooper could verify that they 1 ) overpaid my tax liability by paying property taxes and 2 ) to confirm that a refund would be sent to them.

I filed a dispute through Suntrust a few weeks ago, my dispute was denied and when I called the dispute center and Suntrust told me they called me and left a message for the sales of my mortgages. But I checked my phone logs and voice messages and it turned out I have never received a call or any voice message from Sun Trust. So I filed a complain about Suntrust and questioned if Suntrust made its best due-diligence to inform me that my loans have been transferred and I had a few missing payments. today I received the response from Sun trust. I will attach the letter here. I have a question about the Sun trust 's response. The company knew that my two loans were newly transferred to them and I have never made any payment since the transferring. The apparent reason is that the borrower might not have received the notification and not aware of the changes. Should Sun Trust make sure to let me know or make sure that I am aware of the transferring? On the letter they said they have made a few attempts to call me but unsuccessfully in reaching me. This is ridiculous! First they told me my late payments wont be reported on my report, and then told me Sun Trust called me and left a voice message to inform my missing payments, and now they told me They have made a few attempts to call me but unsuccessfully in reaching me.

My name is XXXX XXXX and I currently have a mortgage through J.P Morgan Chase ending in XXXX. They are not the original lender as XXXX XXXX was the original in which it closed XX/XX/XXXX. My complaint and dispute is the run around and unwillingness to perform a XXXX on my property to assess the XXXX ratio for actual value of the property. My current property is located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Fl XXXX. I was given quite an insulting appraisal and disputed it. I even paid for a second appraisal from a second lender. Long story short I ended up having to take the low evaluation to not lose the property since the initial lender has all of the paperwork prepared for closing. Had I not, the seller was going to re-list the property. The property was appraised for {$480000.00} and I currently owe {$420000.00}. The property itself is worth $ XXXX $ XXXX in the $ XXXX range. Thus why I want a XXXX performed in which I expected to be a simple request not an argumentative debate. My complaint is that Chase refuses to perform a XXXX  to assess the actual property value even at my own expense to remove PMI. I am attaching my PMI disclosure from Better Mortgage that I signed at closing. It does state the general dates and numbers for request and/or auto termination of PMI. What it does NOT state is any requirement/s for me to HAVE to perform SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS in order to request and/or pay for a BPO to be performed! This is not right and outright illegal. After telling me on XX/XX/XXXX in an email that I am attaching that I could pay for an evaluation at my expense now everyone that I speak to refuses. They record their calls as most businesses do and have an associate telling me that I could order a BPO over the phone and even billed my checking account for it on XX/XX/XXXX. I have attached my statement showing the charge. There is nothing on my PMI disclosure that mentions the requirement for significant improvements to be performed and/or anything to do with a time frame for borrower requested removal of PMI on the note in under 2 years to request/demand an evaluation of the property/BPO. This to me is a combination of this financial institution just wanting to continue to get rich off of collecting money from as many customers as possible but most IMPORTANTLY the attempt to combine 2 completely different sets of guideline requirements that are not of the same lender and/or to be used concurrently. I have read over the XXXX of XXXX, lender disclosure from closing lender, and XXXX XXXX. I know that this is not right and I only agreed to what I SIGNED for at closing.

I am leaving one mortgage company and in the process of going to another ( freedom mortgage ). All of these phone calls and agents that i spoke with are all on a recorded line at freedom mortgage. On XX/XX/XXXX i called freedom mort. And talked to an agent XXXX about our XX/XX/XXXX payment that was due. On a recorded line he told me that i had XXXX in unapplied funds and assured me that i could use that money to pay for my XXXX payment. I told him that i would call a couple days later to make that payment. On XX/XX/XXXX i called freedom mortgage and spoke to an agent XXXX ( agent ID XXXX ) to make the XXXX payment using the unapplied funds. I paid the XXXX difference and she added the XXXX of unapplied funds to it to complete the XXXX payment. She gave me a conformation number for payment and both of us were aware that this was going to complete the XXXX payment. On XX/XX/XXXX i received a letter in the mail stating that my XXXX payment was never made and that the XXXX dollars wasnt enough for a full payment and that it was placed in a separate account on hold. I called and spoke with XXXX ( AGENT ID XXXX ) i explained to her what happened and after looking through my account she informed me that agent XXXX put the XXXX to interest and not my XXXX payment. XXXX told me that she was going to put in a request to see if the money could be moved but she had to put in a request and that took 2 days to process. The last question that i asked her was in a worse case scenario will this request be denied and she said no it will not be denied. So i got off the phone with her believing what she said was true and i Immediately called freedom mort back and spoke to a supervisor in the escalations dept and spoke to XXXX agent ID XXXX. She immediately told me that basically XXXX who i spoke to in XXXX lied about me not being able to use the unapplied funds for the payment. They were able to pull the recorded phone call and heard him repeatedly telling me that i could use the money. XXXX told me that since my loan was under modification the money couldnt go to my payment that was due. I informed her that i had spoke to many agents from freedom and none of them mentioned this to me. So now due to their mistakes and lies i am behind a whole payment. On XX/XX/XXXX agent XXXX called me and told me that she was working with another supervisor named XXXX the mitigation supervisor and XXXX agent ID XXXX to see if they could do anything but they called me the next day and told me there was nothing that they could do and that i was behind a payment. I spoke with 3 freedom mortgage agents on the phone and none of them are telling the truth. They misinformed me that i could use that money for my XXXX payment and even gave me a conformation number.

I was provided an Option Agreement Estimate based on the company 's Original Agreed Value of my property at {$370000.00} with a equity pay out amount of {$88000.00} prior to closing costs pending an appraisal. Point 's automated valuation models ( AVM ) listed an Appraised Value of {$450000.00}. The property was appraised XX/XX/XXXX. After multiple attempts to inquire on the delay of the appraisal results, the appraisal was submitted to Point on XX/XX/XXXX. The appraisal came back considerably lower than the initial valuation at {$360000.00}. I was informed by Point representative, XXXX XXXX, via email that Point offered the appraiser ( 7 ) seven additional comparable properties in my area for inclusion to the appraisal report to increase my property valuation. The Point representative, XXXX XXXX, informed me the appraiser rejected Point 's request and therefore my application was declined. I acquired another third party appraisal because the initial one was so delayed. I inquired why they did not acquire a second appraisal? I was given no reply. I felt, based on comments by the Point appointed appraiser when on our property, that she may have a XXXX bias and submit a lowball appraisal of our property. I desired to have a comparison valuation to see if my suspicions were valid. A complete and comprehensive appraisal completed XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX showed our property value assessed via AVM at {$480000.00}. And that was based on the County Assessor 's square footage of 1215 and not the full 1882 square foot as specified in the Point appraiser 's calculations. A XXXX representative, XXXX XXXX, also performed a detailed onsite inspection and confirmed the property 's value was easily near XXXX XXXX in value. The appraisal completed by the Point contracted XXXX excluded 2 comparable home sales directly across the street from our property whose sales took place within the last 6-7 months. I informed XXXX XXXX of Point of this. I feel the appraiser concentrated her comparable properties to areas that reflect lower sales prices and a XXXX and XXXX demographic as opposed to including properties within a 1-3 mile radius of our property that reflect a higher XXXX demographic and much higher home values/sales. I also feel the Point 's appraiser 's use of the Cost Approach and the replacement value did not reflect the current market rates for construction materials, construction fees, etc. and was severely under valued and a poor reflection of our property and the improvements made therein. I also hold Point culpable, since they refused to perform a second appraisal and denied my application even though they obviously disagreed with the results of the appraisal report they originally contracted for.\", Company public response='Company disputes the facts presented in the complaint', Company='Point Digital Finance, Inc.', State='FL', ZIP code='33405', Tags=None, Consumer consent provided?='Consent provided', Submitted via='Web', Date sent to company='2022-02-03', Company response to consumer='Closed with explanation', Timely response?='Yes', Consumer disputed?='N/A', Complaint ID='5182053'),\n",

The modification that was offered to me is only a 14 % reduction versus the mandated 25 % reduction required under Covid 19 alm modification for fha loans. In order to achieve the 25 % reduction, mortgagees are required to do a partial claim of the principal if the term extension and rate reduction are insufficient. No partial claim principal reduction was done, despite having an additional {$67000.00} of partial claim funds that could have been applied to reduce the principal and achieve the 25 % reduction. Further, I was supposed to be given 30 days to respond to this letter and was given 12 calendar days, as a response was required by XX/XX/XXXX. I called to inquire abt these discrepancies and was rebuffed and told that this was my only option for loan modification, given no explanation as to why the correct modification guidelines were not followed or employed, and told basically to sign the papers and return them by XX/XX/XXXX or foreclosure proceedings will be initiated. I called again to speak to someone else who then told me that my principal should actually be higher than my original principal that had been owed, and that the {$300.00} savings that they are offering me is sufficient. It is clear that because this loan modification program is not incentivized, that mortgagees will lose out on interest that will result from partial claims on principal balances, because it will reduce the balance on which interest is calculated and accrued, and therefore they are not reducing the principal balance as required, and are forcing the consumer to pay additional interest that under law should be placed under the partial claim loan, which is zero interest.

My loan number is ****. In XX/XX/XXXX, I requested for forbearance for COVID-19 hardship. The forbearance period was from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. In XXXX, I requested for an extension. This extension was approved until XX/XX/XXXX. During the forbearance period I continued to receive late statements and delinquency notices from XXXX XXXX XXXX. Therefore, I constantly called every month to verify that I was still in forbearance. At the end of XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX  discussing next steps when exiting the forbearance period. This document arrived with a lengthy application. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX asking if I needed to complete this document. The customer service representative transferred me to loss mitigation. Loss mitigation stated that they sent the application by accident. However, I had three options to handle the payments that were not made during the forbearance period. The options were, 1 ) I could pay the balance in full 2 ) Arrange a payment plan and 3 ) defer the payments to the end of the loan. At that time, I requested for my complete balance to be deferred. After this, I continued receiving mortgage statements that had a balance that should have been deferred. In XXXX, my balance changed from {$2800.00} to {$1100.00}. My XXXX statement also represented that I had a deferred balance of {$2300.00}. I kept calling regarding the balance being incorrect on my statement and that the complete forbearance was not deferred correctly. At this time, I was reassured that they would process the forbearance extension. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called to check if I needed to make a payment in XXXX, or if the payments resumed in XXXX. Customer service stated I needed to make a payment. Therefore, I made the payment as requested and continued making my payments. I consistently called requesting for the balance to be fixed. I was told by customer representatives that it was escalated and to give it 30 days every call on multiple calls. In the mean time, I was preparing to sale my home to purchase a new home. I seen the regulations for FHA were that you had to make XXXX on time payments after the forbearance period in order to qualify for a home loan. On XX/XX/XXXX I called to request another escalation on the deferral. I was reassured by XXXX that the deferral would be processed in 7 business days. However, that never occurred. At this time, I had applied for my home loan, was pre-approved, had two contracts on my home to sale, and found a new home to purchase. I began to call on a regular basis. Each time, I was told it was being escalated, or sent to a supervisor for the deferral to be processed and the documents to be corrected. By the end of XXXX, nothing had been resolved and I still had a balance on my mortgage statements. Therefore, I was requested to pay my balance in full to have my current loan in good standing. I made my XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX, the remaining {$1100.00} balance ( that was originally supposed to be deferred ) on XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX payment. On XXXX XXXX, I was informed by loss mitigation that they processed the deferral, but I had already paid the balance so there was nothing to defer and that my loan would be reinstated. I have requested for all notes, call logs, and documentation regarding my account from the research department. The majority of these documents I had never seen and some of the items I have requested have not been provided. A forbearance opt-out document ( XXXX ) was in the documents that were provided. This document is dated XX/XX/XXXX and stated that I was out of the forbearance plan and to continue making my monthly payments. The one issue with this document is my forbearance ended in XX/XX/XXXX, not XX/XX/XXXX. Due to the failure of correctly processing the forbearance deferment when originally requested ( or the multiple times after ), contradicting documents, and mortgage statements stating DELINQUENCY or LATE PAYMENTS, I am in a very difficult situation. I am unable to obtain a new home loan unless the documents are corrected, or a letter is drafted on the behalf of Dovenmuehle and/or XXXX XXXX XXXX to address the issues as followed : There were no late payments as the account was in forbearance The forbearance period ended in XX/XX/XXXX The deferral was not processed correctly, or the months that did not process were not done in a timely manner therefore the loan was reinstated once paid in full The payments that did not process for deferral did not have a due date and therefore are not late An overall explanation of the situation from Dovenmuehle and/or XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding the situation The frustration is, I completed everything as needed, and continued my payments when the Forbearance ended. However, the corporations who I relied on to properly handle the Forbearance and Deferment, did not process their responsibilities correctly. Therefore, this is preventing me from obtaining a home loan. Fortunately, I had the sale of my home fall through, or otherwise I would be homeless. However, I currently have three offers on my home that are waiting to be accepted. Also, I am under contract on a home that was supposed to close on XX/XX/XXXX. I have placed earnest money, option fees, appraisal fees, and inspection fees on this home that I will lose if this is not corrected.

The company has had a sale date every 30 days since XXXX so according to them this means I can never get a modification. Then last night after sending second complaint with all evidence on complaints number XXXX. The company Nation Star/Mr. Cooper sent me an email, it was encrypted so I filled out my password etc to verify it was them. It then showed me an email that said they had opened a modification request on XX/XX/XXXX and they were going to give me until XX/XX/XXXX to get my papers in. I was so happy ... I thought finally after 4 years they are going to follow the law. Well my sale date was today XX/XX/XXXX. I got up this morning thinking I'm going to call and talk to somebody about email at Nation Star but when I went to my emails, the email they sent me was gone. They took it back. It was just a way for them to trick me and so hopefully they could sell my home without me filing Bankruptcy to stop it. I can now find no trace of it. When I called both XXXX XXXX at Nation Star and Mr Cooper he acted stupid like he couldn't see in their system that they ever sent me anything. It is governor XXXX who advised the law in state of California was to require mortgage lenders to provide an option to request modification. I have not been allowed to. Now they played games with me to try to stop me from filing an emergency bankruptcy petition. I can not tell you how much pain I was in trying to get to courthouse this morning due to the extreme XXXX XXXX  I have. Can't anyone stop them? They have been pulling so many things more than listed here for XXXX  XXXX XXXX. I'm so disheartened that nobody will see what is going on and help. I tried to get XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX legal aid but he gave me this huge list of requirements to get from the investor XXXX XXXX XXXX and they would not provide them in time so at the last minute he said he could not help me. My only way is to suddenly come into money or for XXXX to do a miracle and somebody maybe see this complaint to finally help me. Isn't it illegal for them to fake send me an email saying they have opened a modification request and then rescend it? To actually take the email back from my computer after I have opened it? I cant even find the email ... .they took it back. Please, it is my heartfelt plea. Make Mr Cooper/Nation Star and XXXX XXXX XXXX do the right thing here and give me a modification. I know I qualify because I was a loan officer for years. They should have to give me the house for the 4 years of XXXX that they have dragged me through. I am not to proud to beg.

Packet is in process and will be submitted. Hello XXXX Management, the entire Advocacy Team for my modification efforts, et al, RE : XXXX Webfile Transcript of Modification Efforts and Investor Rejections : Nationstar Loan Number : XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX Home Loan Number : XXXX and XXXX ID # XXXX -- -COPY ALSO ATTACHED I have attached a partial transcript that identifies communication with the servicer in the past-this is a partial and not full transcript, as the full transcript is more than 100 pages longthe partial transcript is intended to isolate some of the instances of the investors rejection of viable modification option in the past. Please note the particular case where the servicer had approved a modification, I accepted it, and then the investor, XXXX  XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX, rejected a plausible affordable payment solution. I have multiple situations where the servicer had felt a modification was doable, and then the investor, XXXX   XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX, rejected it. Please note in the transcript where I have isolated only a few instances of my efforts to date regarding attempts for modification and at the end of each process, the investor, XXXXI XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX, rejected the proposal for modification. I have attached, a copy, of the entire transcript that shows all my interactions with the servicer and their reporting back to my XXXX web file the repeated decisions, which have been rejections by the investor, XXXX XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX My full XXXX transcript of communication with the servicer is over 100 pages long which I have saved and preserved for future use if needed. The following transcript is a streamlined version of communication to give you an idea of the struggles of attrition during the entire life of this modification process. Please make note wherever the name servicer is mentioned in a row, on the transcript, and the response by the servicer. Please review the attached full transcript as needed to present an even clearer picture of the content of each modification rejection by the investor, XXXX XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX. Please note, on particular case, in the row dated XX/XX/XXXX, after the servicer had extended a modification solution with an affordable payment, after I accepted the solution, the investor XXXX  XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX, again, rejected it, even after the servicer had extended terms. Note in particularly, that the servicer states in the transcript communication on line item dated XX/XX/XXXX, that the investor has the final say in all matters regarding the extension of any affordable modification solution. It was amazing that the servicer, at the time, approved a modification, posted it on my XXXX web file to accept, and not even minutes later, the investor denied the plausible modification solution, which caused the servicer to state in the end, that the decision is at the sole discretion of the investoreven the servicer was surprised and baffled by the investors rejection of a reasonable affordable payment solution. Therefore, in the end this is why, although we will remain optimistic that a solution with an affordable payment can be extended, however, the past history by this investor, XXXX XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX, does not suggest a favorable outcome resulting in an affordable payment solution although I qualify when you look at the calculated housing, back, and front end ratios which were calculated by a reputable housing agency. In the end, we hope this will not be another act of futility by the servicer with no actual decision making powers, who have been willing to extend a reasonable affordable payment solution. But the servicer has had their willingness to extend an affordable solution, rejected by the servicer they work for : XXXX XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX. This is why I am requesting that my advocacy team make an aggressive effort to contact the investor XXXX  Securitizations, master serviced by XXXX XXXX ; they are the ones who have rejected every offer, not the servicer. One of the servicers representatives even demonstrated their frustration that their attempts to extend an affordable payment solution were rebuffed by the investor. Because of their frustration, the servicer identified the following person, XXXX XXXX, as the liaison to the investor team, please contact him, or the other staff members listed below, at the following contact info to determine why they continue to deny and reject reasonable affordable payment modification offers and other programs that would assist us to stay in our home with reasonable solutions to include : all Principal Reduction Programs, options through theHAMP, Hardest Hit Funds, Transcript of Modification Efforts and Investor Rejections XXXX ID XXXX Page 2 of 11 Keep Your Home CA, and other proprietary solutions, etc. All of the aforementioned programs that could have been applied to my situation for an affordable mortgage payment, that we qualified forhave all been denied, and not accepted, but rejected by the investor XXXX XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX ( Please see the indented, highlighted paragraph below, the entire content between the hash lines was sent back to me from XXXX XXXX email addresses automatic reply system.

The lack of payments over the past few years was not our intent nor purpose. We sincerely thought we would have had a modification with an affordable payment within 30 days of visiting XXXX, for modification assistance, the first time we sought them for help with our mortgage. The multiple rejections by the investor team are the reason this modification process is still being pursued, is ongoing, and has become a drudgery. The investors rationale that we received a modification in the past has been obviously demonstrated as no more than a repayment plan that increased our mortgage amount and placed us in a worsened hardship position, that modification repayment plan did not produce an affordable payment! I will provide all of these instances ( of investor rejections ) in my full XXXX transcript via email for my entire advocacy team to review. Please see partial transcript attached below regarding some of the relevant communication from the investor XXXX  XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX as communicated via the servicer -- the powerless fronts for the investor. Please, any member of my advocacy team, you may use this letter as my authorization for you to contact the aforementioned possible front persons with the investor team : XXXX XXXX, master serviced by XXXX XXXX to continue your advocacy for a reasonable solution for an affordable payment modification once and for all.

We were one of the unfortunate borrowers to receive an XX/XX/XXXX ARM loan. The second mortgage became default in early XXXX. Our first mortgage was modified until the XXXX program, and at that time I was under the impression from my ex that the second mortgage had been modified under the first mortgage. He was the one who took care of the finances. Fast forward to XXXX, we split up, I moved out in XX/XX/XXXX and ended up moving back and taking over the mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX. Part of the divorce decree was for me to refinance the property in my name. I started the process right before Covid hit, and when Covid hit I was pushed back because most of my income had been affected. ( I was a waitress, and all the restaurants shut down ) So I started the process again in XXXX. The title company came back and mentioned the second mortgage. Clueless, I asked what I needed to do to fix it, and was told I needed verification of the debt or a statement stating the debt has been fulfilled or resolved. I clearly know nothing as I assumed it was merged. I went to the courthouse and obtained the deeds. Both of the deeds are from XXXX, which has since been bought multiple times. I only have one mortgage that appears on my credit report. Currently XXXX is the mortgage holder for the first mortgage, so I reached out to them. Upon calling them, I was denied access for not verifying the correct address. Curious as I have spoken to them multiple times since I have taken the mortgage over in XXXX. So I logged on to the account and found his address has been changed to receive mailings. So I call XXXX back, verify with his address that is on file and change it back to the property address which I stay at. I ask them to investigate the second details and I provide them with the records I obtained from the courthouse. Then a few days later, the title company is reaching out to him about signing over the deed. This is where the fun begins! This is when I found out about the second mortgage company from him and that he has been receiving the statements all along. I asked for all the information, all he gave me was the name, so I googled, searched and called. While speaking with a representative, I ask when the address on the account was changed. I was notified that it was changed in XXXX and again in XXXX. I asked them to mail me a letter stating such, and receive it. We recently went to court about my not refinancing no show cause and basically the judge didn\\'t listen to a word I said since I didn\\'t have a lawyer. ( Believe it or not, I called multiple local lawyers, apparently everyone started holiday break in XXXX, I just got a call from one of them the other day in regards to my voicemail .... ) Moving forward I contacted them and told them I am to be notified immediately of any and all changes made on the account. I asked them to provide me with when the change occurred and all they said was since it was done \"\" electronically \\'\\' they have no record of when the change was made.

I have called, emailed and mailed to them more than ten times for this issue and very frustrated for their action and efforts.
